1	continued	The NHS has had a pretty horrible Christmas, with A&Es; swamped, more than a dozen hospitals declaring
2	assumption	major incidents and a bleak midwinter bed shortage worthy of first-century Bethlehem
3	no-unit	.
4	continued	Various causes
5	continued	have been cited
6	continued	:
7	assumption	not enough money, too many ill people, the government, the previous government and GPs
8	no-unit	.
9	continued	But a major contributory factor appears
10	assumption	to be the NHS 111 helpline
11	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
12	continued	That's the number
13	continued	you're now supposed
14	continued	to ring
15	continued	if
16	assumption	you don't need an ambulance
17	no-unit	.
18	common-ground	Not any time you don't need an ambulance, obviously
19	no-unit	.
20	continued	Not, for example
21	continued	,
22	continued	when
23	other	you need a fire engine or the police instead
24	no-unit	- stick with 999 for those
25	no-unit	.
26	continued	It's for
27	continued	when
28	continued	you don't need an ambulance, a fire engine or the police
29	continued	but
30	continued	,
31	no-unit	if	cond
32	assumption	you were pressed
33	no-unit	,	cond
34	continued	you'd have
35	continued	to admit
36	continued	it's an ambulance
37	assumption	that you don't need least
38	no-unit	.
39	no-unit	If	cond
40	continued	you were
41	continued	to pick one of those things
42	continued	you don't need and try
43	assumption	to make some sort of use of it	cond
44	no-unit	,	cond
45	assumption	you'd go for the ambulance
46	no-unit	.
47	no-unit	On balance
48	no-unit	.
49	no-unit	Because
50	no-unit	,
51	no-unit	come
52	no-unit	to think of it
53	no-unit	,
54	assumption	you might actually need an ambulance
55	no-unit	.
56	continued	I absolutely can't think of a simpler way of
57	assumption	describing it
58	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
59	continued	It seems
60	assumption	that NHS 111 works slightly differently from NHS Direct
61	no-unit	,
62	continued	which preceded it
63	assumption	and was staffed by nurses
64	no-unit	,
65	continued	in that very few of the people
66	continued	who answer the phone
67	anecdote	are medically trained
68	no-unit	.
69	continued	They have no more chance of
70	continued	fixing a human body themselves
71	continued	than
72	continued	someone in an EE call centre has of
73	assumption	generating a 3G signal using an alkaline battery and a radio transmitter
74	no-unit	.
75	anecdote	They work off a computer system called Pathways
76	continued	which tells them
77	continued	what questions
78	continued	to ask
79	continued	and then
80	continued	,
81	continued	the answers having been typed in
82	continued	,
83	continued	what
84	anecdote	advice to give
85	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
86	continued	As	Modd-NU
87	continued	triage goes	Modd-NU
88	continued	,	Modd-NU
89	assumption	this is flawed
90	no-unit	.
91	continued	The first stage of it - the decision
92	continued	to opt for 111 rather than, on the one hand, 999 or, on the other, a paracetamol and a lie-down
93	assumption	- is conducted by the patients themselves
94	no-unit	.
95	continued	This ensures
96	continued	that the new service gets a nice mix of those
97	continued	who are definitely dying
98	continued	but don't want
99	continued	to be any trouble and malingerers
100	assumption	who are losing the courage of their convictions
101	no-unit	.
102	continued	Then the next stage is a sort of medical version of those magazine surveys
103	continued	that claim
104	continued	to tell you
105	continued	whether
106	continued	you're romantic or sociopathic
107	assumption	or spiritual or a typical Scorpio
108	no-unit	.
109	no-unit	But
110	no-unit	,
111	continued	 regardless of
112	continued	whether
113	continued	most of your answers are As, Bs or Cs
114	continued	,
115	continued	the system still just advises
116	continued	you to consult someone trained
117	continued	to diagnose
118	continued	whether	Modd-NU
119	continued	there'	Modd-NU
120	continued	s anything really wrong with you	modd-ASM
121	continued	,	Modd-NU
122	continued	rather than waste any more time describing your nasty rash to a guy	Modd-NU
123	continued	whose last job	Modd-NU
124	assumption	was cold-calling about missold PPIs	modd-ASM
125	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
126	no-unit	And
127	continued	that's
128	continued	what
129	continued	causes the trouble for A&E;: the combination of a risk-averse computer algorithm, call centre staff
130	continued	who don't want blood on their hands and the scarcity of GP appointments on public holidays, weekends
131	continued	and
132	continued	when
133	continued	there'
134	continued	s good skiing
135	continued	to be had
136	continued	,
137	continued	is driving thousands of 111 callers into A&E	Modd-NU

139	assumption	to be put on a trolley and ignored like a rum baba in a 70s restaurant
140	no-unit	.

141	assumption	The solution is simple
142	no-unit	:
143	assumption	the algorithm needs some backbone
144	no-unit	.
145	continued	By
146	continued	which I don't mean
147	continued	that the decisions should be taken by actual live vertebrates
148	assumption	- that's obviously unworkably expensive
149	no-unit	.
150	continued	But we need
151	assumption	to be honest with ourselves
152	no-unit	:
153	continued	the whole point of this phone line is
154	assumption	to fob people off 
155	no-unit	-
156	continued	to stop
157	continued	them going to hospital
158	continued	,
159	assumption	not encourage them
160	no-unit	.
161	continued	Deep down, they want
162	continued	to be told
163	continued	they're fine
164	continued	and to stop
165	continued	moaning - otherwise
166	assumption	they would've dialled 999
167	no-unit	-
168	no-unit	so
