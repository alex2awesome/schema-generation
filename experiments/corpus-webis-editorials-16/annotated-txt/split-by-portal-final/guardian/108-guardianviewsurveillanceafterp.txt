0	title	The Guardian view on surveillance after Paris.
-1	par-sep	
1	continued	With two hostage crises playing out in parallel, one given an especially sinister dimension by the targeting of a kosher supermarket, today's pictures from Paris underlined a jihadi threat
2	assumption	that is ugly and real
3	no-unit	.
4	continued	Before
5	continued	the standoffs reached their bloody climax
6	continued	,
7	continued	it was reported
8	anecdote	that one of the Charlie Hebdo gunmen had trained with militants in Yemen
9	no-unit	.
10	anecdote	A link had also emerged between these two brothers and the police-killer behind the supermarket siege
11	no-unit	,
12	continued	in which several hostages are thought
13	assumption	dead
14	no-unit	.
15	common-ground	Islamist terrorists may be rare
16	no-unit	,
17	no-unit	but
18	continued	nobody
19	continued	who cares for peace or freedom

21	common-ground	to disrupt such menacing networks
22	no-unit	.

23	continued	Against this backdrop
24	continued	,
25	continued	the head of MI5 is bound
26	assumption	to command attention
27	no-unit	,
28	no-unit	and
29	anecdote	on Thursday night Andrew Parker gave a speech about rising threats to British security
30	no-unit	.
31	anecdote	He pointed with justified pride to disrupted plots
32	no-unit	.
33	continued	He stressed, too
34	continued	,
35	continued	that there could be no guarantee
36	anecdote	that every attack would be averted
37	no-unit	.
38	continued	To have pretended otherwise
39	assumption	would have been wrong
40	no-unit	.
41	continued	But Mr Parker is also, in his way, a political player, well aware
42	continued	that spelling out
43	continued	how
44	continued	a UK attack was "highly likely"
45	assumption	will strengthen his hand in the ongoing push for powers
46	no-unit	.
47	continued	And he used the attention
48	continued	that he had grabbed in this way
49	continued	to make a disingenuous case for the sort of
50	continued	snooping
51	continued	whose exposure by Edward Snowden in 2013
52	assumption	caused outrage around the world
53	no-unit	.

54	assumption	The director-general whispered sweet reason
55	no-unit	.
56	continued	He emphasised the oversight
57	continued	the agency faces, and rejected
58	continued	,
59	continued	he said
60	continued	,
61	continued	the lazy insistence that more security had
62	anecdote	to mean less privacy
63	no-unit	.
64	assumption	The tone was good
65	no-unit	;
66	continued	it was the substance
67	assumption	that was wanting
68	no-unit	.
69	continued	He explained
70	continued	how
71	continued	decrypted emails of extremists had been used
72	continued	to foil one major airline plot
73	continued	,
74	continued	and
75	continued	how
76	continued	information was forensically recovered from a second bunch of fanatics, bent on
77	testimony	blowing up London landmarks, after their arrest
78	no-unit	.
79	continued	Such pinpointed
80	continued	(and
81	continued	legally controlled)
82	assumption	intelligence work might, perhaps, also have made a difference in Paris

84	continued	where
85	assumption	both the Charlie Hebdo murderers were on watchlists
86	no-unit	.

87	continued	Mr Parker, however, lurched from
88	continued	detailing such targeted work to
89	continued	making oblique allusions to the entirely sweeping, and until 2013 entirely unacknowledged, probing of communication records, and the interference with internet traffic
90	continued	on the often-spurious pretext
91	assumption	that it is "international" in a purely technical sense
92	no-unit	.
93	continued	These are the practices
94	continued	that give the state such chilling potential
95	assumption	to keep exhaustive tabs on so many citizens
96	no-unit	.
97	continued	But the effect of Mr Parker's intervention is
98	continued	to kick back against necessary reforms, and to pile on the pressure
99	assumption	to put these controversial practices on to a permanent footing
100	no-unit	.
101	continued	As for the oversight he gave such weight to
102	continued	,
103	assumption	its weakness was evident today
104	no-unit	when
105	continued	the chair of the intelligence and security committee, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, uncritically echoed virtually everything
106	continued	that he had said
107	continued	,
108	continued	blithely
109	continued	asserting
110	continued	that it wasn't the intelligence agencies' job
111	anecdote	to spy on ordinary people
112	no-unit	,
113	continued	as if
114	assumption	the Snowden revelations had never happened
115	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
116	continued	Britain is still crying out for a debate
117	continued	that the security services continue
118	assumption	to duck
119	no-unit	.
120	assumption	The dreadful events of Paris do not change that position at all
121	no-unit	.
