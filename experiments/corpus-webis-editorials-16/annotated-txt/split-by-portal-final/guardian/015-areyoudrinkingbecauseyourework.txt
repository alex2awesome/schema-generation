4	continued	are 11% more likely
5	continued	to drink alcohol at risk levels than
6	statistics	those working a standard week

8	continued	The study was compiled by Finnish researchers
9	continued	,
10	anecdote	sampling 300,000 subjects across Europe, Australia and North America
11	no-unit	.
12	continued	Health guidelines suggest

15	continued	It's no surprise
16	continued	that it's a team of Finnish researchers
17	assumption	who are examining the stats around unsafe drinking

19	assumption	Nordic Finland may be a well-known haven of progressive social policy, with an enviable living standard, cradle-to-grave welfare and the world's best education system

21	no-unit	but
22	continued	there is one social problem
23	assumption	the Finns have not yet licked

25	continued	Alcohol-related illnesses and incidents (including accidents

30	assumption	The study is of useful consideration for Australians, of course
31	no-unit	-
32	assumption	we're afflicted with alcohol problems of our own

34	continued	Australian research released only last July revealed

37	statistics	more than 430 are admitted to hospital every day in Australia for alcohol-related reasons

41	continued	That working longer hours
42	continued	has a detrimental effect on an individual's health
43	common-ground	is well established
44	no-unit	.
45	continued	Some have suggested from the results of the Finnish study
46	continued	that alcohol abuse is symptomatic of the "work
47	assumption	hard, play hard" cultures around professions
48	no-unit	- especially
49	continued	because	Modd-NU	
50	continued	workers
51	continued	who shifted into longer-hours jobs during the study
52	continued	were 12% more likely
53	statistics	to develop risky drinking habits as a result
54	no-unit	.

55	continued	Some have also suggested
56	continued	that the scarcity of leisure time for people

59	anecdote	using alcohol as a concentrated form of relaxant
60	no-unit	.
61	continued	This is the opinion of Cassandra A  Okechukwu, assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health
62	continued	who declared of the Finnish findings

68	continued	"As
69	continued	stress increases
70	continued	the activity of brain regions responsible for drug seeking and craving

72	continued	stressful work is often 'addictive' in itself,"
73	testimony	says Wise
74	no-unit	.
75	continued	"This
76	continued	could be a self-perpetuating cycle
77	continued	-
78	continued	work causes stress
79	continued	,
80	continued	which renders
81	testimony	people more prone to addictions to substances and work."

82	continued	Significantly
83	continued	,
84	continued	 the study
85	continued	itself does not claim
86	continued	to prove a causation
87	continued	-
88	continued	leaving open the possibility
89	continued	to discuss the pink elephant
90	assumption	that lurks in the room behind all social discussions of problem drinking: the prevalent, if sometimes well-camouflaged, existence of actual alcoholics

92	continued	Writing in Business Insider
93	continued	,
94	continued	journalist Kevin Loria asked of the study
95	continued	:
96	continued	"Long hours may not cause dangerous drinking
97	continued	,
98	continued	but
99	continued	why
100	testimony	is there a relationship between those two things at all?"
101	continued	The answer is this
102	continued	:
103	assumption	there is not one clear relationship, but potentially several
104	no-unit	.
105	continued	We know, for example
106	continued	,
107	continued	that those suffering active alcoholism seek out environments

110	continued	Why
111	assumption	would the workplace be an exception?
-1	par-sep	
112	assumption	Demanding jobs not only deliver alcoholics out of the worksite just in time for socially-acceptable drinking hours
113	no-unit	,
114	continued	but
115	continued	the stresses associated with long
116	continued	-
117	assumption	hours work provide pretexts aplenty for "self-medicating" with booze

119	continued	Our community continues

124	continued	forgotten
125	continued	is

131	continued	The recovery community calls
132	testimony	this phenomenon "drinking on it"

154	no-unit	Yet
155	continued	while	Modd-NU
156	continued	study after study identifies alcohol as a health, economic and justice burden on the community, and with the statistical acknowledgement
157	statistics	that 3.7 million Australians are currently "drinking at long-term risky levels"
158	no-unit	,
159	continued	we're still - still - struggling
160	continued	to break our social addiction to the old stereotypes of alcoholics being weak-willed, staggering hobos rather than predominantly people with jobs, relationships and families
161	assumption	who are sick with a dangerous medical problem
162	no-unit	.
163	no-unit	If	cond

180	continued	Go back and look at the figures above: 5,500+ deaths and 150,000+ hospital admissions a year
181	assumption	are not the result of mere casual tipples
182	no-unit	.
183	continued	They're the stats of widespread abuse
