1	continued	According to a study by researchers at King's College London, many doctors are failing
2	assumption	to tackle their patients' weight problems
3	no-unit	.
4	continued	Researchers analysed the records of several thousand obese patients and found

21	continued	while	Modd-NU
22	continued	government, schools and other agencies clearly have a role

36	continued	As a busy GP faced with an overflowing waiting room of ill people, it's tempting
37	continued	to avoid
38	anecdote	bringing up the subject

40	continued	I have
41	continued	to pick
42	continued	the right moment and phrase it
43	anecdote	sensitively
44	no-unit	:
45	continued	"Do you feel
46	continued	your weight is an issue?"
47	continued	and "Is there something
48	continued	we can do
49	continued	to help?"
50	assumption	are good openers
51	no-unit	,
52	no-unit	but
53	continued	there needs
54	continued	to be time

101	continued	I think
102	continued	GPs have a responsibility
103	assumption	to initiate a conversation about obesity
104	no-unit	because

110	assumption	losing weight can reduce that risk
111	no-unit	,
