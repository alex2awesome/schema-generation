1	continued	Rather disturbingly, one word seems
2	assumption	to connect the activity of the Paris terrorists and that of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists: iconoclasm
3	no-unit	.
4	continued	I say disturbingly
5	continued	,
6	continued	because
7	continued	pointing out some common ground
8	continued	may be seen as
9	assumption	blurring the crucial distinction between murderous bastards and innocent satirists

11	no-unit	Nonetheless	modd-NU
12	no-unit	,	modd-NU
13	continued	 it strikes
14	continued	me as fascinating
15	anecdote	that the cartoonists were profoundly iconoclastic in their constant ridiculing of religion
16	no-unit	(all religions, it must be noted)
17	no-unit	-
18	continued	yet it is precisely this same ancient tradition of iconoclasm
19	continued	that inspires
20	continued	Jews and Muslims to resist representational art and, in its most twisted pathological form, to attack the offices of a Paris magazine and slaughter those
21	continued	whose only weapon
22	assumption	was the pen
23	no-unit	.
24	continued	So what's	modd-NU
25	assumption	the connection?	m-question
-1	par-sep	
26	continued	In one sense an iconoclast is someone
27	common-ground	who refuses the established view of things
28	no-unit	,
29	common-ground	who kicks out against cherished beliefs and institutions
30	no-unit	.
31	assumption	Which sounds pretty much like Charlie Hebdo
32	no-unit	.
33	continued	But the word iconoclast also describes those religious people
34	continued	who refuse and smash representational images	modd-NU
35	continued	,	modd-NU
36	assumption	especially of the divine	modd-NU
37	no-unit	.
38	anecdote	The second of the Ten Commandments prohibits graven images 
39	no-unit	-
40	continued	which is
41	continued	why
42	assumption	there are no pictures of God in Judaism or Islam
43	no-unit	.
44	continued	And theologically speaking, the reason
45	continued	they are deeply suspicious
46	continued	of divine representation is
47	continued	because
48	continued	they fear
49	assumption	that such representations of God might get confused for the real thing
50	no-unit	.
51	continued	The danger
52	continued	,
53	continued	they believe
54	continued	,
55	continued	is
56	continued	that we might end up
57	continued	overinvesting in a bad copy, something
58	continued	that looks a lot like
59	continued	what
60	assumption	we might think of as god
61	no-unit	,
62	no-unit	but
63	assumption	which, in reality, is just a human projection
64	no-unit	.
65	continued	So much better then
66	assumption	to smash all representations of the divine
67	no-unit	.

68	continued	And yet this, of course, is
69	continued	exactly what
70	assumption	Charlie Hebdo was doing
71	no-unit	.
72	continued	In the bluntest, rudest, most scatological and offensive of terms, Charlie Hebdo has been insisting
73	assumption	that the images people worship are just human creations - bad and dangerous human creations
74	no-unit	.
75	continued	And in	modd-NU
76	continued	taking the piss out of such images	modd-NU
77	continued	,
78	continued	they actually exist in a tradition of religious iconoclasts going back as far as Abraham
79	assumption	taking a hammer to his father's statues
80	no-unit	.
81	assumption	Both are attacks on representations of the divine
82	no-unit	.
83	continued	Which is
84	continued	why
85	continued	the terrorists, as well as being murderers, are theologically mistaken in
86	continued	thinking
87	assumption	Charlie Hebdo is the enemy
88	no-unit	.
89	no-unit	For
90	continued	if
91	continued	God is fundamentally unrepresentable
92	continued	,
93	continued	then any representation of God is necessarily less than God and thus
94	continued	deserves
95	continued	to be fully
96	continued	and
97	assumption	fearlessly attacked
98	no-unit	.
99	no-unit	And
100	continued	what
101	continued	better way of	modd-NU
102	continued	doing this than through satire	modd-NU

104	continued	like	modd-NU
105	assumption	scribbling a little moustache on a grand statue of God	modd-NU

108	assumption	that might demur from this logic
109	no-unit	.
110	anecdote	For the Christian story (ie Christmas) tells of God coming into the world as a human being
111	no-unit	.
112	continued	And in
113	continued	doing this
114	assumption	the divine takes on a representational form
115	no-unit	.
116	continued	Jesus
117	continued	,
118	continued	says St Paul
119	continued	,
120	testimony	is the image of the invisible God
121	no-unit	.
122	assumption	Without this the whole western tradition of Catholic religious art and eastern tradition of icons is utterly inconceivable
123	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
124	continued	So I can see
125	continued	how
126	continued	some Christians might find
127	assumption	disrespectful images of God a la Charlie Hebdo insulting
128	no-unit	.
129	no-unit	After all	modd-NU
130	no-unit	,	modd-NU
131	continued	 they believe
132	continued	it's possible for images genuinely

134	no-unit	.
135	no-unit	But
136	no-unit	if	cond
137	continued	images can't capture God
138	continued	- and
139	continued	that's the Jewish/Islamic position
140	assumption	- then bring on the cartoonists
141	no-unit	.
142	continued	They should be encouraged

146	assumption	bears any resemblance to anything legitimately God-like
147	no-unit	.
148	assumption	They are like Moses bringing down the golden calf

150	assumption	It is the ancient job of the iconoclast
151	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
152	no-unit	But
153	no-unit	,
154	assumption	 of course, these terrorists weren't really interested in theology
155	no-unit	.
156	continued	They thought
157	continued	that Charlie Hebdo's cartoonists were insulting their human tribe, a tribe
158	assumption	they called fellow Muslims
159	no-unit	.
160	assumption	And maybe they were
161	no-unit	.
162	no-unit	But
163	continued	whatever
164	continued	else was happening
165	continued	,
166	continued	it was the atheist cartoonists
167	continued	who were performing the religious function
168	continued	and the apparently believing Muslims
169	assumption	who had forgotten their deepest religious insights
170	no-unit	.
