1	continued	The current state of the US and UK governments' ass-backwards approach to cybersecurity was on full display this week
2	continued	-
3	continued	culminating with British Prime Minister David Cameron and President Obama meeting
4	assumption	to discuss the issue at the White House on Friday
5	no-unit	.
6	continued	When	Modd-NU
7	continued	it comes
8	assumption	to cybersecurity
9	no-unit	,
10	continued	it seems
11	continued	the UK and US want
12	continued	to embrace every crazy idea except

16	continued	The UK's Cameron suggested earlier in the week
17	continued	he wants
18	anecdote	to outlaw certain forms of encryption
19	no-unit	,
20	assumption	which could potentially lead to some of the world's most popular messaging apps (like iMessage and WhatsApp) being banned in the UK
21	no-unit	.
22	continued	That speech had been ridiculed from all angles for the past few days, with
23	continued	various experts labeling
24	continued	it a nightmare for Internet security
25	continued	- on par with authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China
26	assumption	- and economically devastating for the British information technology industry
27	no-unit	.

28	continued	Meanwhile
29	continued	,
30	continued	 the White House has proposed a huge expansion of penalties under the highly-controversial law
31	continued	that was used
32	continued	to prosecute
33	assumption	Reddit co-founder and privacy rights advocate Aaron Swartz
34	no-unit	.
35	no-unit	If
36	assumption	passed	cond
37	no-unit	,
38	continued	the administration's proposal could further criminalize mundane Internet activity - for example
39	continued	,
40	continued	potentially allowing for a ten-year jail sentence for
41	continued	sharing your HBO GO password 
42	continued	-
43	continued	all to supposedly target foreign hackers

46	no-unit	Less than 24 hours before Cameron-Obama the meeting
47	no-unit	,
48	continued	the Guardian published a secret report based on
49	continued	previously unreleased Snowden documents showing
50	continued	that the US government is fully aware
51	continued	that encryption is vital for security
52	continued	,
53	continued	and
54	continued	that the government risked
55	continued	leaving
56	continued	themselves vulnerable
57	continued	if
58	continued	they didn't start
59	continued	implementing it on their own systems
60	testimony	quicker
61	no-unit	.
62	assumption	The British government likely knows this too
63	no-unit	:
64	anecdote	many of their employees use email encryption
65	no-unit	;
66	no-unit	and
67	continued	UK even recommend
68	continued	citizens use encryption
69	testimony	to protect their data on a government website
70	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
71	continued	At the press conference after the meeting, Obama commendably didn't embrace Cameron's proposal
72	continued	when
73	assumption	asked about it
74	no-unit	,
75	no-unit	and
76	continued	even Cameron seemed
77	continued	to at least appear
78	assumption	to back off his own anti-encryption proclamation
79	no-unit	,
80	continued	saying	Modd-NU
81	continued	he's "not trying
82	testimony	to enunciate some new doctrine."
-1	par-sep	
83	no-unit	But
84	continued	just because	Modd-NU
85	continued	Cameron's been proven
86	continued	to be technically illiterate
87	continued	and may be attempting
88	assumption	to publicly back away from his most radical proposal
89	no-unit	,
90	continued	that doesn't mean
91	assumption	that he won't later push forward
92	no-unit	.
93	assumption	FBI director Jim Comey proposed similar legislation to Cameron's just a few months ago
94	no-unit	,
95	no-unit	and

97	continued	as	Modd-NU
98	assumption	Comey did in late 2014
99	no-unit	.
100	assumption	Plus, the rest of Cameron's plan is downright scary for Internet privacy even without a formal encryption ban
101	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
102	continued	And then there's the White House's so-called solution to the cybersecurity problem
103	continued	,
104	anecdote	which they unveiled earlier this week
105	no-unit	.
106	continued	President Obama introduced

108	continued	we had
109	anecdote	to do something about incidents like the headline-grabbing Sony hack, or the juvenile hijacking of US Central Command's twitter account
110	no-unit	-
111	no-unit	but
112	continued	what
113	continued	he didn't say

115	assumption	that those proposals wouldn't have stopped those attacks at all
116	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
117	continued	Part of the Obama administration's proposal would dramatically expand the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the oft-abused and notorious statute

119	assumption	to threaten the late Internet activist Aaron Swartz with 35 years in jail
120	no-unit	.
121	continued	(Aaron later took his own life while
122	anecdote	awaiting trial
123	no-unit	.)
124	continued	The CFAA already has incredibly harsh penalties, so much so
125	continued	that there's been a movement for years
126	assumption	to reduce them
127	no-unit	.
128	no-unit	And
129	continued	how
130	continued	the administration thinks
131	continued	increasing CFAA penalties is going
132	continued	to worry either North Korean hackers or ISIS sympathizers (or
133	continued	more likely pranksters)
134	continued	who take advantage of negligent password practices
135	assumption	is anyone's guess
136	no-unit	.

137	continued	It would also put countless security researchers at further risk of prosecution, the exact type of people
138	continued	the government should
139	assumption	consulting with
140	no-unit	before making these ill-thought proposals, not driving underground
141	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
142	no-unit	At the same time
143	no-unit	,
144	anecdote	 Congress has re-introduced their annual "info-sharing" cybersecurity bill
145	no-unit	,
146	continued	which is really just a thinly-veiled way
147	assumption	to siphon off more of Americans' private data without court oversight
148	no-unit	.
149	continued	As
150	continued	EFF put it
151	continued	,
152	continued	the bill "offered new authorities
153	continued	that could be abused by companies
154	continued	to spy on users
155	continued	,
156	continued	and offered broad legal immunity for
157	testimony	disclosing the information obtained with the government
158	no-unit	.
159	continued	Sometimes they even granted companies the ability
160	continued	to 'hack back'
161	continued	...
162	testimony	a perfect storm threatening our online privacy."
163	assumption	The President's alternative bill is a bit less sweeping, but not by much
164	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
165	continued	So, Congress and Obama seem
166	continued	to be finally on the same page about something: harsher penalties
167	continued	that won't reach the hackers
168	continued	they were worried about
169	continued	and invasive "info-sharing"
170	continued	that doesn't come close to
171	assumption	solving existing problems
172	no-unit	.
173	continued	God forbid
174	continued	there be a full rebirth of the US-UK relationship
175	continued	,
176	continued	or
177	other	that both sides of the Atlantic seek a full, two-state ban on encryption
178	no-unit	.
179	assumption	Even full government gridlock would be better than that
180	no-unit	.
