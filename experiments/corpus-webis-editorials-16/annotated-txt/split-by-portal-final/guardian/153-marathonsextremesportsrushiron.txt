1	continued	I'm not sure
2	continued	when
3	anecdote	the abnormal became normal
4	no-unit	.
5	continued	I remember a time not so long ago
6	continued	when
7	assumption	a marathon runner was a mythical beast
8	no-unit	-
9	continued	we all knew someone
10	continued	who knew someone
11	assumption	who had run a marathon
12	no-unit	,
13	no-unit	but
14	assumption	most of us had only ever seen these creatures on the TV in their emaciated, long-limbed flow
15	no-unit	.
16	no-unit	But
17	assumption	now everyone knows a marathon runner
18	no-unit	and
19	assumption	they just look like normal people

21	continued	Somewhere along the way	Modd-NU
22	continued	,	Modd-NU
23	assumption	marathons became commonplace
24	no-unit	and
25	continued	a whole new breed of extreme activities came along	Modd-NU
26	continued	-	Modd-NU
27	continued	the Ironman triathlon; multi-day cycle events like John O'Groats to Lands End; crazy ultra marathons like the Thames Path 100; and events	Modd-NU
28	continued	that defy description like the Tough Mudder
29	assumption	.
30	no-unit	While
31	continued	a lot of extreme challenges are
32	assumption	to do with ultra endurance
33	no-unit	,
34	continued	the Tough Mudder is short but involves	Modd-NU
35	continued	getting hurt	modd-ASM
36	continued	.	Modd-NU
37	continued	Sometimes by electric shocks	Modd-NU
38	continued	.	Modd-NU
39	assumption	And fire	modd-ASM
40	no-unit	.
41	continued	What
42	assumption	is wrong with you, Mudders?
-1	par-sep	
43	continued	I have no idea
44	continued	what
45	assumption	caused the rise of the extreme sports as a phenomenon
46	no-unit	,
47	no-unit	but
48	continued	I do know
49	continued	what
50	anecdote	happened for me
51	no-unit	.
52	continued	After many years of corporate life and general indolence I found
53	continued	myself resting a glass of champagne on a large belly, unable
54	anecdote	to get to the buffet without puffing
55	no-unit	.
56	continued	Horrified at the realisation	Modd-NU
57	continued	that I had become Mr Creosote from The Meaning of Life
58	continued	,
59	continued	I resolved immediately
60	anecdote	to sign up for the Great Edinburgh Run
61	no-unit	.
62	anecdote	The GER was only 10k
63	no-unit	but
64	anecdote	it terrified me and filled me with doubts
65	no-unit	:
66	continued	what
67	continued	if
68	anecdote	I came last?
69	continued	Do I have
70	anecdote	to run all the way?
71	anecdote	Will I be the fattest dude on the course?
72	anecdote	Four months later I completed it easily
73	no-unit	.
74	anecdote	And then I signed up for a marathon
75	no-unit	.
76	anecdote	And then an Ironman
77	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
78	continued	And this is the thing - every step of the way
79	continued	you reassess your judgment of
80	continued	what
81	assumption	is crazy
82	no-unit	.
83	assumption	It becomes a rapidly escalating obsession
84	no-unit	.
85	continued	What
86	continued	seemed like a hardcore event reserved solely for proper endurance loons
87	assumption	soon becomes just within reach
88	no-unit	.
89	continued	Six years after the GER, the only event
90	continued	I still consider
91	continued	to be bonkers beyond belief
92	assumption	is the Marathon des Sables
93	no-unit	.
94	continued	And that's
95	continued	only because
96	continued	everyone knows
97	assumption	that Scots melt in the desert
98	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
99	continued	My personal theory for the rise of the extreme sports is
100	continued	that life has become
101	assumption	sterile
102	no-unit	.
103	continued	The chances of
104	continued	really getting an adrenaline rush in day-to-day life
105	assumption	is minimal
106	no-unit	,
107	no-unit	so
108	continued	people search out ways
109	assumption	to re-engage with life
110	no-unit	.
111	continued	After	Modd-NU
112	continued	completing two Ironman events	Modd-NU
113	continued	,	Modd-NU
114	continued	I can testify
115	continued	that the feeling of
116	continued	sweeping down the finish chute after 140.6 miles to
117	continued	pumping pop music
118	continued	,
119	continued	flashing lights and a cheering crowd
120	anecdote	is the ultimate buzz
121	no-unit	.
122	no-unit	But
123	continued	finishing a marathon, in an empty car park, in the dark, in the pouring rain
124	continued	,
125	anecdote	is easily its equal for an overwhelming inner sense of achievement
126	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
127	continued	The other personal joy
128	continued	I get from training for events
129	anecdote	is the quiet time
130	no-unit	.
131	continued	Although	Modd-NU
132	assumption	modern life is humdrum
133	no-unit	,
134	assumption	it is noisy
135	no-unit	,
136	no-unit	and
137	continued	even a three-mile run gives me the chance
138	anecdote	to clear my head, breathe cold fresh air and feel the wind on my skin
139	no-unit	.
140	continued	Within 10 minutes of
141	continued	beginning a run
142	anecdote	my head is clear
143	no-unit	,
144	anecdote	I am calm
145	no-unit	and
146	anecdote	I am reset
147	no-unit	.

148	continued	The side benefit of all this training (and probably the reason
149	continued	that most people start
150	assumption	) is health
151	no-unit	.
152	continued	If
153	continued	you run, cycle or swim you
154	assumption	lose weight and feel more vital for it
155	no-unit	.
156	assumption	You are fitter, stronger and sleep more soundly
157	no-unit	.
158	assumption	You are fit for life - the kid climbing on your shoulders, the run for the bus
159	no-unit	,
160	continued	even
161	continued	just climbing
162	assumption	the stairs become infinitely more manageable
163	no-unit	.
164	assumption	It also sets a great example
165	no-unit	-
166	continued	my three-year-old has now collected finisher's medals at Ironkids and Loch Ness Marathon and loves
167	anecdote	being outside
168	continued	because	Modd-NU
169	continued	that's
170	continued	what
171	anecdote	mummy and daddy do
172	no-unit	.

173	assumption	The increase in demand cannot be satisfied
174	no-unit	.
175	continued	A new event seems
176	assumption	to spring up every day
177	no-unit	.
178	continued	No longer restricted by a single Ironman distance	Modd-NU
179	assumption	you can do double, triple or even (for the proper enthusiasts) deca Ironman
180	no-unit	.
181	assumption	You can run the 268 frostbitten, British-winter miles of the Spine Race
182	no-unit	.
183	assumption	You can even get teargassed in the Tough Mudder
184	no-unit	.
185	continued	Whether	Modd-NU
186	continued	for the T-shirt, the tattoo or just the sheer pride of accomplishment	Modd-NU
187	continued	,	Modd-NU
188	continued	extreme sports are here
189	assumption	to stay
