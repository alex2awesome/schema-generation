2	continued	,
3	continued	suggesting
4	continued	a series of reforms "to make sure
5	continued	that the United States never again engages in actions

10	continued	after	Modd-NU
11	continued	her office released the landmark (but still heavily redacted)
12	anecdote	Senate torture report
13	no-unit	,
14	continued	Feinstein is now calling for legislation
15	anecdote	to strengthen the prohibition against torture
16	no-unit	.
17	assumption	This is a laudable and necessary step
18	no-unit	,
19	no-unit	but
20	common-ground	torture has been a felony for decades
21	no-unit	.
22	common-ground	So have war crimes, lying to Congress and obstruction of justice
23	no-unit	.
24	continued	The fundamental problem is
25	continued	that the US government has been unable or unwilling
26	assumption	to enforce those laws against the CIA
27	no-unit	.
28	no-unit	If	cond
29	continued	reform does not confront the reasons for that failure
30	continued	,
31	continued	it may not deter the United States from
32	assumption	engaging in torture under a future president
33	no-unit	.

34	continued	To the extent	Modd-NU
35	continued	that federal prosecutors have simply lacked the political will
36	assumption	to investigate the CIA
37	no-unit	,
38	continued	there'
39	continued	s not much
40	assumption	Congress can do about it
41	no-unit	.
42	continued	But legislation could address many of the other factors
43	continued	that allowed
44	assumption	the CIA to torture prisoners, destroy evidence and lie to investigators with impunity
45	no-unit	.
46	assumption	There is the CIA's reliance on secret "torture memos" written by the Office of Legal Counsel 
47	no-unit	-
48	assumption	which exploited some weaknesses in the legal definition of torture
49	no-unit	,
50	assumption	but depended far more heavily on absurd legal arguments and false representations of fact by the CIA
51	no-unit	.
52	continued	There'	Modd-NU
53	assumption	s the unethical role of CIA doctors and psychologists in monitoring interrogations
54	no-unit	.
55	continued	And above all, there remains
56	continued	the CIA's ability
57	continued	to keep all the evidence of its crimes
58	assumption	classified
59	no-unit	.

60	continued	The only explanation the justice department has ever provided for the failure
61	continued	to indict a single CIA officer for torture, war crimes, homicide, destruction of evidence or any of the other crimes
62	continued	the Senate report documents is a bland statement
63	continued	that "the admissible evidence would not be sufficient
64	testimony	to obtain and sustain a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt"
65	no-unit	.
66	continued	The justice department refuses
67	anecdote	to answer questions about the role played by top-secret classification in that decision, or disclose any of the records from the criminal investigations
68	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
69	continued	But we do
70	continued	know
71	continued	that until
72	continued	the Senate report was released
73	continued	,
74	continued	the Obama administration took the position
75	continued	that every detail of an individual detainee's torture in CIA custody was top secret	modd-ASM
76	assumption	- including former CIA prisoners' memories of their own treatment, the locations of black sites and the names of all the witnesses	modd-ASM
77	no-unit	.
78	continued	We know the CIA redacted from the report not only the names but even the pseudonyms of nearly every CIA officer and contractor involved in the program, and every country
79	assumption	that hosted a black site
80	no-unit	.
81	continued	And we know
82	continued	that every last civil suit brought by CIA torture
83	assumption	victims has been dismissed on national security grounds
84	no-unit	.
85	continued	So it's difficult
86	continued	to imagine
87	continued	how
88	continued	a prosecutor could have made a torture case against the CIA without
89	continued	disclosing this evidence
90	continued	-
91	continued	and even harder
92	assumption	to imagine the agency allowing its release
93	no-unit	.

94	continued	In theory, Obama's December 2009 executive order on national security classification should prevent the CIA from
95	continued	using secrecy
96	assumption	to place itself beyond the rule of law
97	no-unit	,
98	continued	since	Modd-NU
99	continued	the order specifically forbids classifying information
100	testimony	to "conceal violations of law"
101	no-unit	.
102	assumption	In practice, though, the prohibition is virtually never enforced
103	no-unit	.
104	continued	The Obama administration - like the Bush administration before it - takes the position
105	continued	that the CIA's criminal actions can be legitimately classified
106	continued	if
107	assumption	they are "intelligence sources and methods"
108	no-unit	.
109	continued	And neither Congress, nor the president, nor the courts have imposed any legal limit on
110	continued	what
111	assumption	counts as an intelligence source or method
112	no-unit	.
113	continued	In practice, the phrase has come
114	continued	to mean "anything
115	continued	the intelligence community doesn't want
116	assumption	you to know."
117	continued	Congress needs
118	continued	to write a legal definition of "intelligence sources and methods"
119	continued	that imposes real limits, and makes clear
120	assumption	that it excludes torture and other crimes
121	no-unit	.

122	continued	Feinstein and her staff deserve tremendous credit for
123	continued	finally breaking through the wall of secrecy
124	assumption	that the CIA built around its torture program, in the face of fierce opposition from the agency and the White House
125	no-unit	.
126	continued	But their investigation did not begin
127	continued	until after
128	anecdote	the black-site program had already ended, in large part because of leaks to the press
129	no-unit	.
130	continued	Despite staffers' scrupulous protection of classified information, the CIA subjected them to unlawful surveillance, tried
131	continued	to have
132	continued	them prosecuted
133	continued	and is still trying
134	assumption	to retaliate
135	no-unit	.
136	no-unit	Yet
137	assumption	the report is still full of unjustified redactions
138	no-unit	,
139	no-unit	and
140	continued	the Department of Justice refuses
141	continued	to either reopen its criminal investigations into torture or explain
142	continued	why
143	assumption	they were closed in the first place
144	no-unit	.

145	no-unit	As
146	no-unit	it stands right now
147	no-unit	,
148	continued	torture is a crime - but so is revealing evidence of torture
149	assumption	that the CIA wants hidden
150	no-unit	.
151	continued	And it's only the second crime
152	continued	that gets
153	assumption	you prosecuted
154	no-unit	.
155	continued	Yes, let's
156	assumption	strengthen the laws against torture
157	no-unit	.
158	continued	But let's
159	continued	also weaken the CIA's power
160	assumption	to conceal the evidence
161	no-unit	.
