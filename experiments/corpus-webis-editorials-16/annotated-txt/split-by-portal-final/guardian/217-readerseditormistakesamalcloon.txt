110	continued	do not necessarily need
111	testimony	to be footnoted
112	no-unit	,
113	continued	I think
114	continued	that on this occasion it was a mistake

-1	par-sep	
129	continued	Editors were still concerned
130	assumption	that the story lacked clarity
131	no-unit	,
132	no-unit	and
133	continued	further changes were made to the first few paragraphs

154	no-unit	,

156	anecdote	a correction was published online that evening and in print on Tuesday 6 January
157	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
158	no-unit	However
159	no-unit	,
160	continued	what
161	continued	I had not initially realised
162	continued	was
163	continued	that Clooney had co-authored an article for the Huffington Post website with Mark Wassouf
164	continued	,
165	anecdote	who also represents Fahmy, published on Sunday 4 January
166	no-unit	.
167	continued	In it, primarily, she set out the issues
168	anecdote	facing the three men including Fahmy, but also addressing her concerns about the Guardian story
169	no-unit	.
170	continued	In it she raised a fresh concern
171	anecdote	of which we were unaware
172	no-unit	.
173	continued	She described those
174	continued	who warned her of a possible arrest

176	continued	any attempt was made
177	testimony	to publish the report as "experts in Egyptian affairs"
178	no-unit	,
179	no-unit	whereas
180	continued	they were described in the text of the Guardian story as "Egyptian officials"
181	continued	and
182	continued	a subheading said
183	anecdote	she was "threatened by the authorities"
184	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
185	continued	The Huffington Post story said
186	continued	:
187	continued	"An article was published in the Guardian newspaper on 2 January 2015
188	continued	stating
189	testimony	that officials threatened Amal Clooney with arrest in Egypt in connection with her representation of Fahmy
190	no-unit	.
191	continued	The incident
192	continued	that was recounted in fact
193	testimony	arose in early 2014
194	no-unit	when
195	continued	the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute (IBA) 
196	continued	-
197	continued	which was organizing the launch of a report co-authored by Mrs Clooney
198	continued	- was warned by experts in Egyptian affairs
199	continued	who were consulted on the launch
200	continued	that she and her colleague risked arrest
201	continued	if
202	continued	they launched the report in Cairo, in light of the criticisms made in the report and recent prosecutions for 'crimes' like
203	testimony	insulting the judiciary, government or military in Egypt
204	no-unit	.
205	continued	As a result of these warnings
206	continued	,
207	continued	the IBA decided
208	continued	that it was not safe
209	continued	to hold the launch in Cairo
210	continued	,
211	continued	and
212	continued	the authors were forced
213	testimony	to hold it in London instead
214	no-unit	.
215	continued	This incident arose before Mrs Clooney's involvement in the Fahmy case
216	continued	,
217	continued	before
218	testimony	the current president was in office and in a context entirely unrelated to this case
219	no-unit	...
220	continued	More importantly, the focus today should not be on the risks
221	testimony	that lawyers or journalists faced in the past
222	no-unit	.
223	testimony	The focus should be on the risks of free speech in today's Egypt."
-1	par-sep	
224	no-unit	When
225	continued	the Guardian asked Clooney on 5 January for more details of the individuals
226	anecdote	who gave the warning
227	no-unit	,
228	continued	she replied
229	continued	that the language
230	continued	she used
231	continued	had been reviewed by a colleague in the International Bar Association's Human Rights Institute
232	continued	who was involved in
233	continued	writing the report and organising the launch
234	continued	,
235	continued	who agreed with the description
236	testimony	that they were "experts in Egyptian affairs"
237	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
238	continued	I am not able
239	assumption	to establish any more details about them
240	no-unit	.
241	continued	I think
242	continued	the Guardian believed
243	continued	that, in the context of the interview, the "they"
244	continued	to which Clooney refers
245	continued	were Egyptian officials
246	assumption	who had given the warning
247	no-unit	.
248	continued	But we didn't confirm that before publication, and in the light
249	anecdote	of that we have made a further set of changes to the headline, subheading and text
250	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
251	continued	In my view, it is a legitimate story and a matter of public interest
252	continued	that there was a warning of possible arrest in relation to
253	continued	publishing in Egypt a report about flaws flaws in the country's judicial system
254	assumption	that subsequently contributed to the conviction of the three men
255	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
256	continued	The report said
257	continued	Egypt's judicial system was not as independent
258	continued	as
259	testimony	it could be
260	no-unit	.
261	continued	It pointed out
262	continued	that officials in the ministry of justice have wide powers over nominally independent judges, and highlighted the control
263	testimony	the government can exert over state prosecutors
264	no-unit	.
265	assumption	There is a clear link
266	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
267	no-unit	However
268	no-unit	,
269	continued	the Guardian collectively made a number of errors by
270	assumption	conflating two key aspects of the story, including a significantly misleading headline
271	no-unit	,
272	no-unit	and
273	other	I apologise on behalf of the newspaper to Amal Clooney for those errors
274	no-unit	.
