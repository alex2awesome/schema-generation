21	continued	Mrs Merkel's characteristics - her steadiness, her careful thinking through of problems, her solid control of her party, her reluctance
22	continued	to move

70	no-unit	.
71	continued	Contrast Mrs Merkel's forthright remarks on the anti-Islamic demonstrations

77	no-unit	.
78	assumption	Britain's difficulties are not at the top of the heap

130	continued	while	Modd-NU
131	assumption	her parliamentarians squabble and everyone gets bored of the subject and moves on

134	continued	how
135	continued	she dealt with the scandal of the NSA
136	assumption	monitoring her mobile phone
137	no-unit	:

145	assumption	Her dealings with Russia's President Vladimir Putin over the past year show signs of a learning curve
