0	title	The real American Sniper was a hate-filled killer. Why are simplistic patriots treating him as a hero?

22	no-unit	But
23	continued	however effective
24	continued	it is as a piece of cinema
25	continued	,
26	continued	even
27	continued	a cursory look into the film's backstory - and particularly the public reaction to its release 
28	continued	-
29	continued	raises disturbing questions
30	continued	about which stories
31	continued	we choose
32	continued	to codify into truth

34	continued	and
35	assumption	whose, and why, and the messy social costs of transmogrifying real life into entertainment

37	continued	Chris Kyle, a US navy Seal from Texas, was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and claimed
38	anecdote	to have killed more than 255 people during his six-year military career
39	no-unit	.
40	continued	In his memoir
41	continued	,
42	continued	Kyle reportedly described
43	continued	killing as "fun", something
44	anecdote	he "loved"
45	no-unit	;
46	continued	he was unwavering in his belief
47	continued	that everyone
48	continued	he shot
49	assumption	was a "bad guy"
50	no-unit	.
51	continued	"I
52	continued	hate the damn savages,"
53	testimony	he wrote

55	testimony	"I couldn't give a flying fuck about the Iraqis."
56	testimony	He bragged about murdering looters during Hurricane Katrina

63	no-unit	However
64	continued	we diverge politically	Modd-NU
65	continued	,	Modd-NU
66	continued	I have enough faith in Eastwood's artistry and intellect
67	continued	to trust
68	assumption	that he is not a black-and-white ideologue
69	continued	- or, at least
70	continued	,
71	continued	that he knows
72	assumption	that the limitations of such a worldview would make for an extremely dull movie
73	no-unit	.
74	continued	But the same can't be said for Eastwood's subject, or
75	continued	,
76	continued	as
77	continued	response to the film has demonstrated
78	continued	,
79	assumption	many of his fans

81	continued	As
82	continued	Laura Miller wrote in Salon
83	continued	:
84	continued	"In Kyle's version of the Iraq war, the parties consisted of Americans
85	continued	,
86	continued	who are good by virtue of
87	continued	being American
88	continued	,
89	continued	and fanatic Muslims
90	continued	whose 'savage, despicable evil' led
91	continued	them to want
92	continued	to kill Americans simply
93	continued	because
94	testimony	they are Christians."

95	continued	Adds Scott Foundas at Variety
96	continued	:
97	continued	"Chris Kyle saw the world in clearly demarcated terms of good and evil
98	continued	,
99	continued	and
100	continued	American Sniper suggests
101	continued	that such dichromatism may have been key to both his success and survival
102	continued	;
103	testimony	on the battlefield, doubt is akin to death."
-1	par-sep	
104	testimony	Eastwood, on the other hand, Foundas says, "sees only shades of gray"
105	no-unit	,
106	no-unit	and
107	assumption	American Sniper is a morally ambiguous, emotionally complex film
108	no-unit	.
109	no-unit	But
110	assumption	there are a lot of Chris Kyles in the world
111	no-unit	,
112	no-unit	and
113	continued	the chasm between Eastwood's intent and his audience's reception touches on the old Chappelle's Show conundrum: a lot of white people laughed at Dave Chappelle's rapier racial satire for the wrong reasons, in ways
114	assumption	that may have actually exacerbated stereotypes about black people in the minds of intellectual underachievers
115	no-unit	.
116	assumption	Is that Chappelle's fault?	m-question
117	assumption	Should he care?	m-question
-1	par-sep	
118	continued	Likewise
119	continued	,
120	continued	 much of the US right wing appears
121	continued	to have seized upon American Sniper with
122	continued	similarly shallow comprehension - treating it with the same unconsidered, rah-rah reverence
123	continued	that they would the national anthem or the flag
124	assumption	itself
125	no-unit	.
126	continued	Only a few weeks into its release, the film has been flattened into a symbol
127	continued	to serve the interests of an ideology
128	assumption	that, arguably, runs counter to the ethos of the film itself
129	no-unit	.
130	continued	How much
131	continued	,
132	continued	if
133	continued	at all
134	continued	,
135	continued	should Eastwood concern himself with fans
136	continued	who misunderstand
137	assumption	and misuse his work?
138	continued	If
139	continued	he, intentionally or not, makes a hero out of Kyle
140	continued	-
141	continued	who, bare minimum
142	continued	,
143	continued	was a racist
144	continued	who took pleasure in
145	continued	dehumanising and killing brown people
146	continued	- is
147	continued	he responsible for
148	assumption	validating racism, murder, and dehumanisation?
149	continued	Is he a propagandist
150	continued	if
151	assumption	people use his work as propaganda?
-1	par-sep	
152	continued	That question came to the fore last week on Twitter
153	continued	when
154	anecdote	several liberal journalists drew attention to Kyle's less Oscar-worthy statements
155	no-unit	.
156	continued	"Chris
157	continued	Kyle boasted of looting the apartments of Iraqi families in Fallujah,"
158	testimony	wrote author and former Daily Beast writer Max Blumenthal
159	no-unit	.
160	continued	"Kill
161	continued	every male
162	continued	you see,"
163	continued	Rania Khalek quoted
164	continued	,
165	testimony	calling Kyle an "American psycho"
166	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
167	assumption	Retaliation from the rightwing twittersphere was swift and violent, as Khalek documented in an exhaustive (and exhausting) post at Alternet
168	no-unit	.
169	continued	"Move
170	continued	your America hating ass to Iraq, let ISIS rape
171	continued	you then cut your cunt head off
172	continued	,
173	continued	fucking media
174	continued	whore muslim,"
175	testimony	wrote a rather unassuming-looking mom named Donna
176	no-unit	.
177	continued	"Rania, maybe
178	continued	we to take
179	continued	you ass overthere
180	continued	and give it to ISIS

182	continued	Dumb bitch,"
183	testimony	offered a bearded man named Ronald

187	assumption	(we may never know)
188	no-unit	.
189	continued	"Waterboarding

193	continued	"I wouldn't mind
194	testimony	giving you two a demonstration."

195	assumption	The patriots go on, and on and on
196	no-unit	.
197	continued	They cannot believe
198	continued	what
199	assumption	they are reading
200	no-unit	.
201	continued	They are rushing to the defence of not just Kyle, but their country
202	continued	,
203	continued	what
204	assumption	their country means
205	no-unit	.
206	continued	They call for the rape or death of anyone ungrateful enough
207	assumption	to criticise American hero Chris Kyle
208	no-unit	.
209	continued	Because
210	continued	Chris Kyle is good
211	continued	,
212	continued	and brown people are bad
213	continued	,
214	continued	and
215	continued	America is in danger
216	continued	,
217	continued	and
218	assumption	Chris Kyle saved us
219	no-unit	.
220	continued	The attitude echoes
221	continued	what
222	assumption	Miller articulated about Kyle in her Salon piece
223	no-unit	:
224	testimony	"his steadfast imperviousness to any nuance, subtlety or ambiguity, and his lack of imagination and curiosity, seem particularly notable"
225	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
226	continued	There is no room for the idea
227	continued	that Kyle might have been a good soldier but a bad guy
228	continued	;
229	continued	or a mediocre guy doing a difficult job badly; or a complex guy in a bad war
230	continued	who convinced himself
231	continued	he loved
232	continued	killing
233	continued	to cope with an impossible situation
234	continued	;
235	continued	or a straight-up serial killer exploiting an oppressive system
236	continued	that, yes
237	continued	,
238	continued	also employs lots of well-meaning, often impoverished, non-serial
239	continued	-
240	continued	killer people to do oppressive things over
241	assumption	which they have no control
242	no-unit	.
243	continued	Or

245	assumption	who find joy in food and sunshine and family, and anguish in the murders of their children
246	no-unit	.
247	continued	Or
248	continued	that you can support your country while
