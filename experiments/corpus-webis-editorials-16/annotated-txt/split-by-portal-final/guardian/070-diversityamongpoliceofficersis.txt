1	continued	In Ferguson, Missouri, 50 of the 53 police officers are white in a city
2	statistics	that is two-thirds African American
3	no-unit	.
4	continued	In Connecticut's state capital
5	continued	,
6	statistics	Hartford, 66% of the police department is white
7	no-unit	but
8	statistics	only 16% of the residents are
9	no-unit	.
10	continued	And these are just two examples: despite progress over the past 50 years
11	continued	,
12	assumption	many police departments remain predominantly white in cities and towns
13	continued	where
14	statistics	the majority of the population is nonwhite
15	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
16	assumption	There are some important exceptions to the disparity pattern
17	no-unit	.
18	statistics	Several big city police departments are majority-black or majority-Hispanic (Atlanta, Birmingham, Detroit, Washington, Miami, Santa Fe and El Paso, for instance)
19	no-unit	,
20	continued	while	Modd-NU
21	continued	others (such as Chicago) are so diverse
22	assumption	that no single group comprises the majority
23	no-unit	.
24	assumption	Yet for many other cities, the gap between the complexion of the police department and the local population is huge
25	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
26	continued	Why	Modd-NU
27	assumption	does this matter?	m-question
28	continued	Do police officers of different racial and ethnic backgrounds act differently
29	continued	while
30	assumption	on the job?	m-question
31	assumption	Do they have different kinds of relationships with minority communities?	m-question
32	continued	Aren't all officers trained
33	assumption	to do their jobs similarly and to treat all civilians the same regardless of race?	m-question
-1	par-sep	
34	continued	Research shows
35	continued	that, in general in the US, there is not a strong correlation, let alone a causal relationship, between an officer's race
36	continued	and
37	continued	how
38	continued	officers treat
39	continued	members of the public
40	continued	when
41	assumption	they respond to calls from civilians or stop and question them on the streets Statistics
42	assumption	are, of course, not predictive of individual behavior
43	no-unit	,
44	no-unit	and
45	assumption	studies of specific departments or communities vary
46	no-unit	.
47	continued	A 2004 study in Indianapolis (Indiana) and St  Petersburg (Florida) by Ivan Sun and Brian Payne, for example, found
48	continued	that black officers were more likely than white officers working in black neighborhoods
49	statistics	to provide information, referrals to other agencies, and to treat residents respectfully
50	no-unit	,
51	continued	although	Modd-NU
52	continued	the black officers were also more likely
53	statistics	to use physical force against citizens in conflict situations
54	no-unit	.
55	no-unit	But
56	no-unit	,
57	anecdote	 again, most studies find similarities overall in police behavior irrespective of officers' racial background
58	no-unit	.

59	continued	Shared training in the academy, as well as on-the-job socialization by fellow officers, results in more similarities than differences among officers
60	continued	when
61	continued	it comes to their policing activities
62	continued	,
63	continued	including similarities in
64	continued	how
65	continued	officers of all races treat white
66	assumption	versus non-white citizens
67	no-unit	.
68	continued	So we should not view racial diversification on the force as a panacea for
69	assumption	improving police treatment of minorities
70	no-unit	:
71	no-unit	instead if
72	continued	minority officers adopt majority attitudes about those
73	assumption	they serve and protect
74	no-unit	,
75	assumption	it might hardly help at all
76	no-unit	.
77	statistics	A 2008 study in Baltimore, Maryland by Peter Moskos documented precisely this shared mentality among both white and black officers
78	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
79	assumption	But it can pay major dividends in other ways
80	no-unit	.
81	continued	In one poll of 1,791 Americans
82	continued	that I and a colleague conducted for our book, Race and Policing in America
83	continued	,
84	continued	more than 70% of blacks, Hispanics and whites in the United States believed
85	statistics	that a city's police department should have a similar racial composition to the city
86	no-unit	.
87	continued	The same study found
88	continued	that very few blacks and Hispanics (only 5%) want most officers
89	continued	who work in their neighborhoods
90	statistics	to be exclusively of the same race as the residents
91	no-unit	,
92	no-unit	and
93	continued	instead most people prefer
94	continued	to see racially
95	continued	-
96	statistics	mixed teams of officers patrolling their streets
97	no-unit	.
98	no-unit	.
99	continued	Importantly, such diversity can help
100	assumption	to build trust and confidence in the police
101	no-unit	:
102	continued	the more
103	continued	a police department reflects the composition of the local population
104	continued	,
105	assumption	the higher the department's reputation among residents
106	no-unit	,
107	continued	which can provide a foundation
108	continued	to build further trust
109	continued	,
110	assumption	coupled with other needed reforms
111	no-unit	.
112	continued	It also helps, in majority-black or majority-Hispanic cities
113	continued	,
114	continued	if
115	continued	the chief of police comes from that community as well because, as the public face of the department
116	continued	,
117	assumption	he or she can allay suspicions
118	continued	when	Modd-NU
119	continued	controversial incidents occur in a way
120	continued	that white police chiefs may not be able
121	assumption	to do
122	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
123	continued	A diverse police force can also help
124	continued	to decrease the sense
125	continued	that individuals are being stopped
126	assumption	and questioned solely because of their race
127	no-unit	.
128	continued	This clearly applies
129	continued	when
130	assumption	the officers and citizens are of the same race
131	no-unit	,
132	no-unit	but
133	continued	even encounters between white officers and minority citizens may be perceived as less racialized
134	continued	when
135	assumption	the department has a critical mass of minority officers
136	no-unit	.
137	continued	A representative police force can, in other words, have symbolic benefits
138	continued	that enhance the overall status of a police department and also reduce the perception
139	assumption	that actions, such as stops or searches, are based on racial profiling
140	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
141	continued	Most police chiefs realize the advantages of a department
142	assumption	that represents the local community
143	no-unit	,
144	no-unit	but
145	continued	there are big challenges in
146	assumption	recruiting more minority officers
147	no-unit	.
148	continued	Many Hispanics and African Americans are reluctant
149	continued	to consider a career in law enforcement - not surprising, given the history of
150	assumption	policing in America coupled with more recent events
151	no-unit	.
152	continued	Highly-publicized incidents like the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York only make
153	continued	it more difficult for police departments
154	assumption	to recruit minority officers
155	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
156	continued	Recruiters can have some success
157	continued	,
158	continued	however
159	continued	,
160	continued	if
161	continued	they broaden their outreach efforts
162	continued	to include churches and community centers - and
163	continued	if
164	continued	there are pre- existing positive relationships between the police and residents in those minority neighborhoods
165	continued	where
166	assumption	community policing has already taken root
167	no-unit	,
168	assumption	which can be built on
169	no-unit	.
170	continued	Although	Modd-NU
171	continued	troubled interactions between minorities and police garner most of the headlines
172	continued	,
173	continued	there are neighborhoods in American cities
174	continued	where
175	continued	working-class and middle-class black and Hispanic residents - including youths - have better relationships with the authorities than on average
176	continued	,
177	continued	as
178	statistics	I found in a study of Washington DC neighborhoods
179	no-unit	.
180	continued	It is in these communities
181	assumption	that the police can enhance their recruitment efforts and achieve at least some success
182	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
183	continued	Racial diversification is one crucial ingredient in a larger program of reform
184	continued	that is required
185	assumption	to improve police departments throughout the country
186	no-unit	.
187	assumption	A representative police force is not a panacea
188	no-unit	- but
189	assumption	it is a positive reform, and an achievable one
190	no-unit	.
