94	continued	--
95	continued	which purports
96	continued	to make lawful the NSA spying
97	continued	we now all know about

102	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep

106	continued	to prohibit
107	continued	what

113	no-unit	.
114	assumption	It is also a codification of our natural right to privacy

116	continued	It requires
117	continued	that if
118	continued	the government wants nonpublic data from our persons, houses, papers or effects
119	continued	,
120	assumption	it must first present evidence of probable cause to a judge and then ask the judge for a search warrant

139	continued	then nothing would stop the government from fishing expeditions in pursuit of anyone

157	continued	the spies to share
158	continued	what

170	continued	Hasn't every member of the government taken an oath
171	common-ground	to uphold the Constitution?
