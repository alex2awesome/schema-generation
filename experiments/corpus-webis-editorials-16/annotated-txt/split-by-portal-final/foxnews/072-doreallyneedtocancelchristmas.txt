79	assumption	And here's the good news
80	no-unit	.
81	assumption	Even our gift giving can point to the miracle
82	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
83	assumption	So, yes, we give a few gifts to our kids
84	no-unit	.

87	no-unit	For example	Modd-NU
88	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
89	continued	 we've taught our own kids

108	no-unit	And
109	continued	when	Modd-NU
110	continued	we serve and give to others

116	continued	"Whatever
117	continued	you do for the least of your brothers and sisters
118	continued	,

-1	par-sep	
120	continued	So we give gifts to Jesus on his "birthday" by

-1	par-sep	
122	continued	This is

131	continued	The key to
132	continued	fostering generosity in our kids
133	continued	is by
134	continued	making
135	continued	giving something	
136	continued	we do all year round
137	continued	.	Modd-NU

145	continued	how
146	assumption	Jesus first gave his life for us
147	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
148	continued	We have
149	continued	to be so careful
150	continued	not to teach our kids
151	continued	that Christmas is about
152	continued	doing more, trying harder, and being better
153	assumption	to be worthy of gifts
154	no-unit	.

157	continued	that has already been given
158	assumption	-- the unconditional love of God in the birth of Jesus Christ
159	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
160	continued	Our focus shouldn't be on
161	continued	whether or not

165	no-unit	.
166	no-unit	His love
167	no-unit	.

168	no-unit	And
169	no-unit	if
