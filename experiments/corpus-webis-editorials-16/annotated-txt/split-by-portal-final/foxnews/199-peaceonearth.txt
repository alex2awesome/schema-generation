6	continued	And
7	continued	,
8	continued	 there are a lot of people on the other side
9	assumption	who are angry at those efforts
10	no-unit	.
11	continued	And so, this whole battle over
12	continued	whether

16	continued	I suppose
17	continued	it may be hard
18	assumption	to be a non-believer in the religious themes around Christmas and live in our culture

34	no-unit	.
35	continued	I'm a believer, but not without a modicum of compassion for those
36	assumption	who don't share my religious beliefs
37	no-unit	.
38	continued	I can imagine
39	continued	how
40	continued	irritating Christmas must be for those
41	continued	whose whole worldview is built on the belief
42	continued	that Christmas doesn't matter
43	continued	because
44	continued	it points to
45	continued	what
46	assumption	is spurious at best and dangerous at worst
47	no-unit	.

-1	par-sep	
50	continued	I must admit, though
51	continued	,
52	continued	that I get

57	no-unit	or
58	continued	when
59	continued	someone wishes

69	no-unit	.
70	anecdote	Frankly, I listen to a lot of stuff from the other side all the time

75	no-unit	.

86	continued	someone said	Modd-NU
87	continued	,
88	continued	it takes very little
89	assumption	to tick us off
90	no-unit	.
91	continued	Instead
92	continued	,
93	continued	 I'm just going
94	continued	to sing as loudly and as publicly

106	no-unit	.
107	continued	I believe
108	continued	that the reason

110	continued	was
111	continued	to tell us
112	assumption	that he isn't angry
113	no-unit	.
114	no-unit	And
115	continued	when	Modd-NU
116	continued	we make obscene gestures or get mean with those
117	continued	who disagree with us
118	continued	,
119	assumption	it kind of misses the point
120	no-unit	.
121	continued	It becomes a disconnect between
