4	continued	s a good chance
5	continued	you'll see
6	continued	a VA employee sporting a shiny lapel pin
7	continued	that reads
8	assumption	"ICARE."

9	continued	That's an acronym for "Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect and Excellence," a list of words
10	assumption	that represents the VA's "core values."
11	continued	As one of VA Secretary Bob McDonald's first orders of business, the ICARE pins were intended
12	assumption	to signal a renewed commitment to service and honesty at the troubled VA
13	no-unit	.

14	continued	During his confirmation in August, McDonald promised

19	continued	 five months later, most of
20	continued	what
21	continued	veterans have
22	continued	to show for it
23	assumption	are watered-down reforms and a new slogan

30	continued	"We pass historic VA reforms through Congress
31	continued	,
32	continued	and
33	continued	all we got
34	testimony	was a lousy ICARE lapel pin."
-1	par-sep	
35	continued	It's not enough
36	continued	to hire
37	continued	a slick PR firm to devise a catchy acronym
38	continued	that says
39	assumption	you "care"
40	no-unit	;
41	continued	what
42	continued	matters to veterans
43	continued	and
44	continued	their families is
45	continued	that you demonstrate your "care" through the results
46	common-ground	you deliver
47	no-unit	.
48	continued	That is
49	continued	why
50	continued	the ICARE lapel pins are such an affront to those of us
51	assumption	who fought so hard for reform last year
52	no-unit	.

53	continued	So how	modd-NU
54	continued	can veterans get the results	modd-NU
55	continued	we want	modd-NU
56	assumption	to see at the VA in the new year?	m-question
57	continued	We need
58	continued	to continually press McDonald and his department
59	continued	to take a much more decisive approach
60	continued	to reform
61	continued	that gets to the real root of the problem
62	continued	:
63	assumption	an entrenched and unaccountable bureaucracy
64	no-unit	.
65	no-unit	After all	Modd-NU
66	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
67	continued	 it's much easier
68	continued	to put on an ICARE pin every morning
69	continued	than
70	continued	it is
71	continued	to shoulder the shame
72	assumption	that too many VA executives should feel
73	no-unit	.
74	no-unit	Make no mistake about it
75	no-unit	;
76	continued	corrupt employees and a bloated bureaucracy are the problems
77	assumption	that must be addressed -- and urgently
78	no-unit	.

79	continued	To be fair to McDonald
80	continued	,
81	continued	there have been limited signs of progress at the VA, thanks to reforms passed by Congress
82	continued	that bring greater accountability and more patient choice to
83	continued	what
84	assumption	is now the government's second-largest department
85	no-unit	.

93	no-unit	--
94	anecdote	but only after more than 200 days of paid administrative leave
95	no-unit	.
96	continued	A handful of other VA officials have also been forced out, but only after
97	continued	being given a chance
98	assumption	to retire with benefits
99	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
100	assumption	It's a start, but not nearly adequate considering the depth and breadth of dysfunction
101	no-unit	.
102	continued	McDonald must keep up -- or preferably turn up -- the pressure in the year
103	assumption	to come
104	no-unit	.

105	no-unit	Moreover	Modd-NU
106	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
107	continued	 the VA needs
108	continued	to stop
109	continued	resisting the expansion of patient choice for veterans
110	assumption	that Congress has mandated
111	no-unit	.
112	continued	The department has been slow-walking the implementation of the reform law's provisions
113	continued	that would allow veterans
114	continued	who are facing a wait of more than 30 days
115	continued	to see a physician
116	continued	,
117	continued	or those
118	continued	who live far from VA facilities
119	assumption	to consult with a medical provider in the private sector
120	no-unit	.
121	continued	This is an important measure
122	continued	that will ensure veterans more timely access to care
123	continued	,
124	continued	while
125	continued	bringing much
126	continued	needed competitive pressure
127	assumption	to bear on the VA care system
128	no-unit	.

129	no-unit	If	cond
130	continued	he is truly going
131	continued	to put the care of veterans above the agency
132	assumption	he leads	cond
133	no-unit	,	cond
134	assumption	McDonald should make good on his promise and champion patient choice expansion, rather than treat it as a pilot project
135	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
136	continued	In all honesty, the great risk for McDonald in the new year is
137	continued	that he'll "go native" and embrace, defend and shield the dysfunctional culture of the department
138	continued	he promised
139	assumption	to change
140	no-unit	.
141	continued	That's a risk, and a temptation, for anyone
142	continued	who is charged with
143	assumption	leading a large bureaucracy
144	no-unit	.
145	assumption	We cannot allow it
146	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
147	continued	Perhaps McDonald's slowness in
148	continued	taking
149	continued	action is part of a strategy of
150	continued	presenting himself as a friend to VA employees
151	continued	in order
152	assumption	to earn their trust and confidence
153	no-unit	.
154	continued	But it's not bureaucrats
155	assumption	who have lost trust in the VA
156	no-unit	--
157	assumption	it's veterans, taxpayers and Congress
158	no-unit	.
159	continued	It remains
160	continued	to be seen
161	continued	whether
162	continued	he'll reveal
163	continued	himself to be a tough-love manager
164	continued	who will stand up to the self-serving bureaucrats
165	continued	who have proven time
166	continued	and
167	continued	again that they "care" more about their job security and compensation than the patients
168	continued	they are supposed
169	assumption	to serve
170	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
171	no-unit	If	cond
172	continued	McDonald, and the entire VA, want
173	continued	to show
174	assumption	that they truly "care" about veterans in 2015	cond
175	no-unit	,	cond
176	continued	they should resolve
177	assumption	to take off the cheesy ICARE pins and get real results for veterans
178	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
179	assumption	My advice to veterans, their families and advocates is this: Keep up the pressure
180	no-unit	.
181	continued	The VA bureaucracy is expecting
182	assumption	that with scandals fading from the headlines, attention will move elsewhere
183	no-unit	.
184	continued	All
185	continued	they want
186	continued	is
187	continued	to don their pins and go back to the same old way of
188	assumption	doing business
189	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
190	continued	Our job is
191	continued	to keep that from
192	assumption	happening
193	no-unit	.
