1	assumption	Afghan women have come a long way since the dark days of the Taliban regime
2	no-unit	.
3	continued	Yet a key obstacle to this progress continues
4	assumption	to be high levels of violence against women
5	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
6	continued	The legal system has failed
7	continued	to protect women adequately
8	continued	when
9	assumption	it comes to some of the most common crimes against them; rape, domestic violence, underage and forced marriages

14	continued	in 2009, a number of prominent Afghan women's rights activists, members of civil society groups
15	continued	,
16	continued	and
17	continued	some lawmakers came together
18	continued	to draft a bill
19	anecdote	to better protect women through legal channels and to define crimes of violence against women
20	no-unit	.
21	continued	The bill, known as The Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) Law, was decreed into law through an Executive Order by the former Afghan President Hamid Karzaion, on July 20, 2009
22	continued	,
23	continued	while
24	anecdote	parliament was in recess
25	no-unit	.

26	continued	During such periods, the Afghan Constitution allows the president
27	common-ground	to issue decrees for emergency purposes
28	no-unit	,
29	no-unit	but
30	continued	the Constitution also requires
31	common-ground	such decrees to be forwarded to parliament for approval
32	no-unit	.
33	continued	Some women activists nonetheless suggested
34	continued	that it was not necessary
35	assumption	to send the EVAW law to parliament
36	no-unit	.

37	no-unit	Political climate
38	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
39	continued	Others, including myself, argued
40	continued	that although
41	continued	the Executive Order on EVAW was a significant step in the battle for the elimination of violence against women
42	continued	,
43	continued	the law remained vulnerable to
44	anecdote	being reversed by a new president
45	no-unit	.
46	no-unit	Indeed
47	no-unit	,
48	anecdote	 presidential elections were just around the corner
49	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
50	continued	As
51	continued	the drawdown of the international troops drew nearer
52	continued	,
53	continued	we feared
54	continued	that the political climate would make
55	continued	it increasingly difficult
56	anecdote	to get the law anchored in parliament
57	no-unit	.
58	no-unit	In addition	Modd-NU
59	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
60	continued	 we feared
61	continued	that any peace talks with the Taliban could end up
62	continued	sacrificing EVAW in a bid
63	anecdote	to appease the militants
64	no-unit	.
65	continued	Securing parliamentary approval for the law would give us much stronger ammunition in
66	assumption	protecting it against extremist attacks
67	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
68	continued	In order
69	continued	to get an agreement on the EVAW law in parliament
70	continued	,
71	continued	we worked tirelessly for months
72	continued	,
73	anecdote	using three main strategies
74	no-unit	.
75	continued	Firstly, we started a lobbying campaign with those
76	anecdote	who opposed the law, mainly conservatives
77	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
78	continued	Secondly, we went
79	continued	to visit them in their houses
80	continued	,
81	continued	explaining the law to them article by article
82	anecdote	to obtain their signature in support of the law
83	no-unit	.
84	continued	We also organised exchange visits for conservative MPs to other Muslim countries
85	continued	so
86	continued	they could explore
87	continued	how
88	anecdote	these countries had been enforcing similar legislation for decades
89	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
90	continued	Finally we worked through the joint committee in parliament for more than two years
91	anecdote	to develop a consensus on the law and defuse the opposition of conservatives
92	no-unit	.
93	continued	In late 2009, there were only two issues left
94	continued	where
95	anecdote	conservative MPs did not agree
96	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
97	continued	These were the law's punishment of relatives for underage marriage and for polygamy under certain conditions as well as the fact
98	continued	that women's rights advocates wanted
99	anecdote	to include "honour killings" as a specific crime in the law
100	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
101	continued	At this point
102	continued	,	Modd-NU
103	continued	however	Modd-NU
104	continued	,
105	anecdote	 MPs became increasingly preoccupied with the then- upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for Spring 2010
106	no-unit	,
107	no-unit	thus
108	anecdote	the process lost momentum
109	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
110	anecdote	Unfortunately, after the 2010 parliamentary elections, we ended up with a more conservative parliament
111	no-unit	.
112	anecdote	Contested election results left the new parliament paralysed for almost a year
113	no-unit	.
114	anecdote	As a consequence, discussions about the EVAW law only resumed in mid-2011
115	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
116	anecdote	At this time the draft was re-sent to the 18 parliamentary commissions
117	no-unit	.
118	anecdote	All but one of the commissions agreed with the text of the law or presented constructive suggestions
119	no-unit	.
120	anecdote	The final commission, the legislative (Taqnin) committee, headed by the foremost opponent of the EVAW law, submitted 34 pages of suggested amendments
121	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
122	continued	Some of these suggestions were helpful and were duly included, such as a proposal
123	assumption	to have specialised prosecution units in all of Afghanistan
124	no-unit	.
125	continued	As before, we rejected the proposals
126	anecdote	to leave underage marriage and the contraction of invalid polygamous marriages as non-punishable acts
127	no-unit	.
128	anecdote	We similarly rejected a new suggestion
129	continued	which was
130	continued	to close all women's shelters and arrange for the victims of violence
131	anecdote	to stay with relatives instead
132	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
133	continued	Although	Modd-NU
134	anecdote	the opponents were vocal
135	no-unit	,
136	anecdote	they did not outnumber the rest
137	no-unit	.
138	continued	What
139	continued	was damaging
140	continued	,
141	continued	however
142	continued	,
143	continued	 was an unhealthy political rivalry
144	assumption	that ensued among mostly female parliamentarians and supporters of EVAW
145	no-unit	.
146	continued	Some progressive women's rights activists, including some from international organisations, argued
147	continued	that the time was not right
148	continued	to pass the EVAW
149	continued	and
150	anecdote	that it should be left as a presidential decree
151	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
152	continued	There were good reasons for
153	assumption	seeking parliamentary approval
154	no-unit	.
155	continued	Yet some of my colleagues began
156	continued	accusing me of
157	continued	using the bill
158	anecdote	to further my own political career and gain support for my assumed ambitions for the 2014 presidential elections
159	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
160	continued	Instead of
161	continued	supporting EVAW
162	continued	,
163	anecdote	many female MPs stood silent during the parliamentary debates on the bill
164	no-unit	and
165	continued	some even went as far as
166	anecdote	to lobby against it
167	no-unit	.
168	continued	As a result
169	continued	,
170	continued	when
171	continued	the law was presented to the plenary in May 2013
172	continued	,
173	continued	conservative MPs
174	continued	who were opposed
175	continued	to EVAW
176	assumption	were further emboldened
177	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
178	assumption	The new Speaker of the House did not hold a lot a lot of influence
179	no-unit	and
180	assumption	probably, for that reason, did not back the bill either
181	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
182	continued	With the conservative MPs entrenched in their opposition to EVAW, a weak speaker and a lack of support from my fellow female MPs, the EVAW bill failed
183	anecdote	to pass
184	no-unit	.
185	continued	Those of us
186	continued	who saw the passing of EVAW
187	continued	to be beyond politics
188	continued	,
189	continued	and understood its importance for
190	continued	tackling violence against women
191	continued	,
192	anecdote	were left heartbroken
193	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
194	assumption	With the international community now gradually disengaging from Afghanistan, time is running out for Afghan women
195	no-unit	.
196	assumption	We have made important gains since 2001
197	no-unit	,
198	no-unit	but
199	continued	we need
200	assumption	the force of the law behind us to sustain our achievements
201	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
202	continued	We need
203	continued	to arm ourselves with solid laws like the EVAW law
204	assumption	to fight the violence and other ills of our society
205	assumption	which are destroying the souls of our sisters across the country
206	no-unit	.
207	continued	The fact
208	continued	that the EVAW law has not been approved by the parliament
209	assumption	is the reason for its weak implementation rates
210	no-unit	;
211	assumption	many justice officials are questioning the law's status and therefore do not apply it
212	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
213	continued	One promising thing on the horizon is
214	continued	that we now have a president and chief executive
215	assumption	who both understand the multitude of challenges facing women
216	no-unit	.
217	continued	I would like
218	continued	to take this opportunity and call on President Ashraf Ghani and our Chief Executive Dr Abdullah Abdullah
219	assumption	to declare their support for the passage of the EVAW bill
220	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
221	continued	I also call on my female colleagues in parliament and all Afghan women rights activists and our international partners
222	assumption	to set aside their differences and join us in support of the ratification of the bill
223	no-unit	.
224	continued	As the recent parliamentary approval of the BSA shows
225	continued	,
226	continued	when
227	continued	the government and others make
228	continued	something a priority
229	continued	,
230	assumption	the conservative MPs can be isolated
231	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
232	assumption	Times may be difficult now for Afghanistan
233	no-unit	,
234	assumption	differences may be wide
235	no-unit	and
236	assumption	security challenges are growing
237	no-unit	,
238	no-unit	but
239	continued	failure
240	continued	to back the EVAW
241	continued	and allowing
242	continued	it to die
243	assumption	will deal a severe blow to Afghan women's rights
244	no-unit	.
