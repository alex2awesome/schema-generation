139	continued	- should find much
140	assumption	to reflect on in Concerning Violence
141	no-unit	,
142	continued	particularly given Fanon's conclusion regarding the European experiment

155	no-unit	,
156	continued	in which she condemned the liberal American tradition of

160	continued	This tradition entails an obsession with
161	assumption	containing potentially "violent" black reactions to state violence (eg vandalism and looting)

163	assumption	and ultimately prescribes a superior concern for private property and material goods than for black life

167	continued	"Today in the United States
168	continued	many
169	continued	will be grieving for buildings burned
170	continued	and windows broken
171	continued	,
172	continued	while
173	continued	the bourgeoisie will cry out
174	continued	'calm!'
