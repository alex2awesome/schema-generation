56	continued	- all
57	continued	OPEC countries chose
58	continued	to cut prices
59	continued	in order
60	assumption	to hold onto market share
61	no-unit	,
62	continued	this means

75	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
76	assumption	Rising populations, a growing middle class, industry diversification and increasing consumerism has turned a number of countries in the Gulf region into major energy consumers

98	no-unit	If
99	continued	consumer demand continues
100	assumption	to grow
101	no-unit	,
