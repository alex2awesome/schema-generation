17	assumption	In the face of this terrible killing spree in France, at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and then at a kosher supermarket, the overwhelming reaction is revulsion
18	no-unit	.
19	continued	But at the same time, there's a need
20	continued	to respond in other ways as well
21	continued	,
22	continued	to frame a discussion
23	continued	that can prevent this tragedy
24	continued	leading to even more tragedies, or being spun out
25	assumption	to lash out at other innocent people
26	no-unit	.
27	continued	And here is the trouble with the backlash
28	continued	that has already begun

34	continued	France today stages
35	continued	a unity march, an attempt
36	continued	to help heal a wounded nation

40	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
41	continued	But within that discussion

52	continued	to do something	Modd-NU
53	continued	and actually	Modd-NU
54	assumption	doing the thing

65	continued	There is, for media, a responsibility (the abrogation of
66	continued	which clearly does not invite murder)
67	continued	to not be tone deaf about the environments
68	continued	we live in: about ignored hierarchies of control; about powerless minorities and colonial heritage and migration and foreign policy
69	continued	;
70	continued	about
71	continued	how
72	continued	things feel
73	continued	when
74	continued	you are stigmatised, marginalised and scapegoated
75	continued	;
76	continued	about

78	continued	it's like
79	continued	when

81	no-unit	;
82	no-unit	and
83	continued	when

86	continued	who just learn
87	assumption	to be more like the majority
88	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
89	no-unit	If
90	continued	we don't create the space
91	continued	to say these things without
92	continued	casting those
93	assumption	that do so as fanatical supporters of murder
94	continued	, then what	changseg
95	continued	is this limitless freedom of expression
96	continued	we keep
97	continued	insisting
98	assumption	we are firmly on the side of?
-1	par-sep	
99	continued	The demand
100	continued	that we all respond in a mass, uniform way
101	continued	also makes a basic error about
102	continued	how
103	assumption	unity works
104	no-unit	-
105	continued	which is
106	continued	to forget
107	continued	that it can only survive

113	continued	Deadly terrorism seeks
114	assumption	to stamp out the possibility of difference 
115	no-unit	-
116	continued	which is
117	continued	why
118	continued	,
119	continued	in
120	continued	condemning outright those atrocities in France
121	continued	,
122	continued	we need also
123	continued	to keep

126	continued	Meanwhile
127	continued	,
128	continued	 equally fundamentalist is the predictable casting of blame at Muslims and their "backward" culture
129	continued	,
130	continued	painting this as a "clash of civilisations" and insisting
131	assumption	that all Muslims repeatedly apologise for the slaughters in France
132	no-unit	.
133	continued	The now routine insistence
134	continued	that all Muslims apologise for all such atrocities
135	assumption	has spawned a spoof Muslim iCondemn phone app for such eventualities - a curious development
136	no-unit	,
137	no-unit	since
138	continued	we have been led
139	continued	to believe
140	assumption	that Muslims don't actually have a sense of humour

150	assumption	which have already begun
151	no-unit	and
152	assumption	which are obviously bad enough
153	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
154	continued	The danger in
155	continued	blaming Muslims for such atrocities
156	continued	is
157	assumption	that we shirk any responsibility
158	no-unit	.
159	continued	And the harsh reality is
160	continued	that the French killings, just like previous terror atrocities in Britain, just like the European self-proclaimed jihadists
161	continued	that go and fight for the death cult Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
162	assumption	(ISIL), are all homegrown
163	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
164	assumption	We - not just Muslim society, but our societies - are accountable
165	no-unit	.
166	continued	We, not just the fanatics
167	continued	that recruit
168	continued	to
169	continued	and commit mindless terror
170	continued	,
171	continued	are bound up in the causes and the context in a way
172	continued	that makes

174	continued	as
175	assumption	bearing sole responsibility both for the crimes and for their prevention
176	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
177	no-unit	If
178	assumption	we don't own this terrible reality collectively
179	no-unit	,
180	continued	we won't be able
181	assumption	to find a way out of it collectively
182	no-unit	,
183	no-unit	either
184	no-unit	- and
185	continued	that means
186	continued	we won't be able
187	assumption	to find a way out of it at all
188	no-unit	.
