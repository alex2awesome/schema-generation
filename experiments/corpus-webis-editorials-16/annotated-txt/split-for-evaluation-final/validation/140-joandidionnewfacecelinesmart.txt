6	continued	it was
7	continued	that as
8	continued	events played out in Paris last week
9	continued	,
10	continued	I kept thinking of the writer Joan Didion, the star of Celine's latest ad campaign, tiny in black

16	no-unit	Oh, the brilliance of Didion!
17	continued	I like
18	continued	to think of myself
19	continued	as
20	anecdote	wholly resistant to the wicked wiles of big fashion
21	no-unit	,
22	no-unit	but
23	continued	this campaign seemed somehow
24	assumption	to have got through
25	no-unit	,
26	no-unit	and
27	assumption	I was all aflutter
28	no-unit	.
29	continued	What
30	continued	,
31	continued	I wondered
32	continued	,
33	continued	was the provenance of the socking great pendant
34	anecdote	that hung about her neck in Juergen Teller's photograph?
35	continued	Was it
36	continued	by
37	continued	Celine or
38	continued	was it

40	continued	as
41	continued	they say

43	assumption	model's own?
44	assumption	Could I find something similar on eBay?	m-question

50	assumption	has focused mostly on her age
51	no-unit	.
52	anecdote	Didion is 80
53	no-unit	;
54	continued	when
55	continued	she began her career as a writer at American Vogue in the late 50s
56	continued	,
57	continued	the personnel director of the magazine's owner, Conde Nast, would from time to time stop her in the hall and ask her

61	continued	Apparently, we should celebrate Teller's photograph of her as a particularly exalted example of fashion's increased willingness
62	continued	to embrace models with wrinkles, liver spots and histories
63	continued	that trail all the way back to the days
64	continued	when
65	continued	women still wore
66	assumption	white gloves and little hats to work

87	continued	But it's not Didion's age

92	no-unit	.
93	continued	By
94	continued	choosing her
95	continued	-
96	assumption	acclaimed and bestselling, but also trenchant, highly mannered and somewhat complicated - Celine's creative director, Phoebe Philo, is sending out quite a bracing message
97	no-unit	,
98	no-unit	even if
99	continued	the semaphore
100	continued	in which it's written
101	continued	will, alas, be largely illegible to those

105	continued	s something going on beyond the cunning commercial appeal to the kind of conflicted consumer
106	assumption	who values the inner life as much as the outer 
107	no-unit	-
108	continued	I mean the kind of woman
109	continued	whose "buttery" leather tote

117	continued	Isn't this campaign also in the business of
118	continued	suggesting
119	continued	that to be clever and a touch difficult
120	continued	(Didion is nothing if not unpredictable)
121	continued	is
122	assumption	to be timelessly beautiful?
123	continued	That this is, in fact, a state
124	assumption	to which women might like to aspire?
125	no-unit	Oh, Phoebe!
126	no-unit	If only
127	assumption	I could afford your gorgeous, minimalist gear
128	no-unit	,
129	continued	I would dash out and buy something right now just
130	assumption	to say thank you
131	no-unit	.

132	continued	And yet how often
133	assumption	have I chickened out?	m-question
134	continued	How often

136	continued	,
137	continued	to wear
138	assumption	pretty clothes, fun clothes, to embrace colour and print and embroidery?	m-question
139	continued	To toddle along in shoes

152	continued	,	Modd-NU
153	continued	I fear
154	continued	being thought
155	continued	ugly
156	continued	or uncompromising or seeming
157	continued	as if
158	assumption	I have not made an effort
159	no-unit	.
160	continued	I fear
161	continued	,
162	continued	if
163	continued	you will
164	continued	,
165	continued	being seen
166	continued	to be picking a fight
167	continued	,
168	continued	whether
169	continued	by the way
170	continued	I speak
171	assumption	or the way I dress
172	no-unit	.
173	continued	I guess
174	continued	you could say
175	continued	that I wear the swishy frock and high heels the better
176	continued	that I might be allowed, sometimes
177	continued	,
178	assumption	to speak my mind
179	no-unit	.

182	no-unit	.
183	no-unit	But
184	continued	she is not, and never has been
185	continued	,
186	assumption	classically beautiful
187	no-unit	.
188	continued	Nor is she willing
189	assumption	to play the fool
190	no-unit	.
191	assumption	She is discreet, but never decorous
192	no-unit	;
193	assumption	she is fierce, preternaturally observant and, sometimes, a little self-obsessed
194	no-unit	.
195	assumption	And her clothes - unfussy, elegant, practical, a touch forbidding - reflect this
196	no-unit	.
197	continued	What
198	continued	Teller's photograph says to me
199	continued	is: approach with caution
200	continued	;
201	assumption	subject may bite
202	no-unit	.
203	continued	I love the continuity in this, the wholeness, the confidence in the way
204	assumption	that the clothes are an extension of the personality
205	no-unit	- and
206	continued	I salute Phoebe Philo for
207	continued	recognising it
208	continued	,
209	continued	for
210	continued	extolling it to the world as worthy of admiration
211	continued	,
212	continued	as a thing
213	continued	to be replicated by those women
214	assumption	who have the pluck, if not exactly the hard cash
215	no-unit	.
