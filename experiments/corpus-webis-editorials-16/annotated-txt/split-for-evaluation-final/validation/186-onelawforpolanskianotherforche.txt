1	continued	Maybe it's inevitable
2	continued	,
3	continued	now that Julian Assange
4	continued	,
5	continued	has spent almost 1,500 days in the bowels of the Ecuadorian embassy
6	continued	,
7	continued	that memories of

9	continued	he came

21	assumption	rapidly the most preposterous inventions can acquire the status of fact
22	no-unit	,
23	continued	even his colleagues at WikiLeaks have convinced themselves
24	continued	that Assange was incarcerated by a British government determined
25	continued	to keep

28	continued	Among the more opportunistic tweets responding to the massacre in Paris
29	continued	,
30	continued	came this
31	continued	,
32	continued	from the WikiLeaks account
33	continued	:
34	continued	"David Cameron pontificates about freedom of speech
35	continued	while
36	testimony	spending millions detaining #Assange without trial."
37	assumption	At this impressive rate of fabulation, the 2,000th day should see our unhappy visionary gagged in a dripping cell
38	no-unit	as
39	continued	he awaits the death sentence applied to all fugitives
40	continued	who dare speak freely in the Kafkaesque nightmare
41	assumption	that is 21st- century Britain
42	no-unit	.
43	assumption	It would bear as much relation to the facts, after all, as the current myth of his forced detention without trial
44	no-unit	.

45	no-unit	So
46	no-unit	,
47	no-unit	to recap
48	no-unit	:
49	continued	in June 2012, Assange, founder of WikiLeaks
50	continued	,
51	continued	was in the UK, free
52	continued	to speak on any subject
53	continued	he liked
54	continued	,
55	continued	and
56	continued	fighting extradition from Britain to Sweden
57	continued	,
58	continued	where
59	anecdote	he faced allegations of sexual assaults on two women
60	no-unit	.
61	continued	Preferring	Modd-NU
62	continued	to break his bail conditions rather than clear his name in Sweden	Modd-NU
63	no-unit	,
64	anecdote	he sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy
65	no-unit	,
66	continued	where
67	anecdote	he remains to this day
68	no-unit	.
69	continued	It is a source of consternation
70	continued	,
71	continued	at least outside his support base
72	continued	,
73	continued	that the cost of
74	continued	policing the embassy
75	continued	so as
76	continued	to enforce the legal process
77	continued	should Assange ever
78	continued	emerge
79	continued	,

86	no-unit	In short	Modd-NU
87	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
88	continued	 #Assange is not "detained" by anyone or anything other than his own reluctance
89	continued	to face
90	continued	questioning about alleged sex offences, in a country
91	continued	where
92	continued	extradition to the US is no more likely
93	continued	than
94	assumption	it is here
95	no-unit	.
96	continued	But maybe this confusion about his journey from free-speech celebrity to pallid hermit helps
97	continued	one understand
98	continued	why
99	continued	Assange, though accused of sex offences, has survived much of the public opprobrium, internet gossip and suspicion
100	assumption	that dogs other individuals associated with accusations of sexual misconduct, such as the harassment expert Julien Blanc or the Lib Dem octopus, Lord Rennard
101	no-unit	.

107	continued	,
108	anecdote	thousands demand the Nobel prize, along with freedom and protection, for Assange
109	no-unit	;
110	continued	his admirers even attempted
111	continued	to kickstart funds for a statue
112	continued	,
113	continued	honouring the man
114	anecdote	who has portrayed his Swedish accusers as instruments in a smear campaign
115	no-unit	.
116	continued	Other analysts, however, have detected enough evidence of female self-determination
117	assumption	to attribute the women's hostility to everything from sexual jealousy to a bad case of radical feminism
118	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
119	continued	Clearly, Assange's better-informed supporters
120	continued	,
121	continued	who include celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Arundhati Roy and Vivienne Westwood
122	continued	,
123	continued	will be aware of the Swedish allegations and have chosen, for one reason or another
124	continued	,
125	assumption	to set them aside
126	no-unit	.
127	continued	A similar immunity seems
128	continued	to have been conferred on Prince Andrew, following allegations of his sexual impropriety
129	continued	with a minor
130	assumption	who worked for his American friend, a convicted paedophile
131	no-unit	.

137	anecdote	who was lent money by the paedophile
138	no-unit	,
139	continued	there has been no announcement of the type of legal manoeuvre

142	anecdote	that he also took sexual advantage of the 17-year-old
143	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
144	continued	Yet Andrew, too, has so far escaped a petition objecting to him "assisting the economic success of our United Kingdom"

147	testimony	the palace describes his various holidays
148	no-unit	.
149	continued	Perhaps
150	continued	,

153	continued	when
154	continued	he attempted
155	continued	to visit the UK
156	continued	,
157	continued	some other country would be good enough
158	assumption	to help out with a banning order
159	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
160	no-unit	If
161	assumption	the difference between unproven allegations and, in Ched Evans's case, a formal conviction, can satisfactorily explain this variability in public tolerance
162	no-unit	,
163	continued	the footballer's supporters are surely entitled
164	assumption	to compare his treatment unfavourably with, for example, that of Roman Polanski
165	no-unit	.
166	continued	Why
167	assumption	have opponents of Evans's return to football, now or ever, not shown similar concern about the film director's rehabilitation?
168	continued	Polanski's return to Poland, for
169	continued	filming
170	continued	,
171	continued	has just prompted another US extradition request
172	continued	,
173	continued	that he be returned
174	anecdote	to face sentencing pending since 1978
175	no-unit	,

179	continued	It must help, of course
180	continued	,
181	assumption	that successful film directors have not been classified, by whichever national committee rules on fitness for role- modelling, as officially inspirational
182	no-unit	.
183	continued	Polanski, like his colleague Woody Allen
184	continued	,
185	continued	who embarked, in his mid-50s, on an affair with his partner's 19-year- old daughter, sister to three of his children
186	continued	,

-1	par-sep	
193	continued	That responsibility is still monopolised
194	continued	,
195	continued	as
196	continued	repeatedly confirmed in ongoing Evans analysis, by the profession
197	continued	that is, for many of us, more strongly associated than any other - no disrespect to full-time pimps or Sun newspaper editors

199	no-unit	.

200	continued	The Professional Footballers' Association's Gordon Taylor's casual analogy between the plight of Evans, the convicted rapist
201	continued	,

212	continued	,
213	continued	the Premier League Richard Scudamore's "big-titted broads" work-account remains institutionally unworthy of redemption, at least
214	continued	where
215	assumption	women are concerned
216	no-unit	.
217	continued	Maybe it is not irrationally high expectations of football's young ambassadors, so much as an evidence-based recoil from its culture
218	continued	,
219	continued	that has fuelled a special implacability towards Ched Evans, to the point of
220	assumption	closing down his career
221	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
222	continued	His only hope of eventual re-employment in football, at this point, is not

229	continued	Polanski also benefited from extensive celebrity support, including
230	continued	,
231	continued	when
232	continued	he was arrested in Switzerland in 2009
233	continued	,
234	anecdote	a petition for his release signed by, among the British luminaries, Salman Rushdie, Sam Mendes, Stephen Frears, Terry Gilliam, Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson and Tilda Swinton

244	assumption	Perhaps there should be one law for acclaimed intellectuals and another for men such as Ched Evans?
245	no-unit	But
246	continued	if
247	assumption	not, the latter must have at least as good a case as Polanski for re-employment

-1	par-sep	
251	no-unit	Alternatively
252	no-unit	,
253	no-unit	if
254	assumption	a serious sex conviction should cost a footballer his entire career
255	no-unit	(along with the professions routinely closed to sex offenders)
256	continued	then a similar vigilance should, surely, be applied to discernible sleazebaggery in any other profession, from
