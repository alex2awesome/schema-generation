83	continued	What
84	continued	does it mean
85	continued	to be

88	continued	,
89	continued	searching its history
90	continued	to reproduce
91	continued	whatever success
92	assumption	it might have once enjoyed
93	no-unit	.
94	continued	MacGregor's argument is

97	continued	,
98	testimony	it is free of imprisoning and destructive myths
99	no-unit	.
100	assumption	It has become, of necessity, a force for good, too little recognised in Britain in part

112	continued	MacGregor believes
113	continued	Britain does not understand today's Germany, the complexities
114	continued	that delivered it
115	continued	or
116	continued	why
117	continued	it thinks
118	continued	as
119	testimony	it does
120	no-unit	.
121	assumption	Merkel agrees
122	no-unit	.
123	continued	The point of her British trip was not

127	no-unit	,
128	assumption	about which she was stubbornly reticent

135	no-unit	.

136	continued	MacGregor organises the exhibition
137	continued	so that the first big quote
138	continued	you see
139	continued	is
140	continued	Goethe and Schiller's 1796 declaration: "Germany?
141	continued	Where
142	continued	is it?
143	continued	/ I do not know
144	continued	where
145	anecdote	to find such a country."
146	anecdote	There are eight different maps of ever-mutating German territory since 1500
147	no-unit	.
148	assumption	Thus the home of Immanuel Kant, its greatest philosopher, is Kalingrad (then Konigsberg)
149	common-ground	which is now in Russia
150	no-unit	;
151	continued	the city
152	continued	that most influenced
153	anecdote	its greatest poet (Goethe), Strasbourg, is now in France
154	no-unit	.
155	continued	From 1500 to 1806, "German-ness" expressed itself through the loose association of principalities, cities, dukedoms and minor states
156	continued	that was the shifting boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire
157	assumption	until its defeat by Napoleon
158	no-unit	.
159	continued	Then came the nation state
160	continued	that was
161	anecdote	first imperial
162	no-unit	and
163	anecdote	then Hitler's Germany
164	no-unit	.
165	anecdote	Postwar division followed defeat, then reunification
166	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
167	assumption	For Germany, the nation state has been an aberrant, destructive interlude between the Holy Roman Empire and now the European Union - a 21st-century variant of the Holy Roman Empire, but with a single currency, market and trading rules
168	no-unit	.
169	continued	For Germany, it is the only way
170	assumption	to conceive of the future, and create a peaceful and productive Europe
171	no-unit	.
172	continued	Senior German officials talk privately in these terms, categories
173	assumption	that bewilder the British still locked in fundamentally traditional political categories
174	no-unit	.
175	continued	For its neighbours, one downside of Germany's recent past - 1920s hyperinflation - is its quasi
176	continued	-
177	assumption	religious attachment to sound money and budgetary rectitude
178	no-unit	.
179	continued	But the greater German attachment, trumping everything, is
180	continued	to think and build forward
181	assumption	recognising today's realities
182	no-unit	.

183	continued	Thus the Greek political crisis - and the possible confrontation between Germany and the anti-austerity Greek left
184	continued	if
185	continued	it wins the elections
186	continued	- may have a happier outcome
187	continued	than
188	assumption	the British consensus could ever imagine
189	no-unit	.
190	continued	Syriza has the 30 super-rich Greek families
191	continued	that pay no tax and run Greece as a payola for their own interests in its sights as much
192	continued	as
193	assumption	it is targeting Greece's suffocating external debt burden and excess of austerity
194	no-unit	.
195	continued	It is also keenly aware
196	continued	that abandoning the euro for the drachma
197	continued	and
198	assumption	detaching itself from the EU exposes Greece to both huge inflation and the tender mercies of Turkey
199	no-unit	.

200	assumption	The potential deal with Germany is clear
201	no-unit	.
202	continued	The left will forge a proper liberal Greek democracy with the 30 families paying tax
203	continued	,
204	assumption	secure the forgiveness of much of its external debt but stay in the euro
205	no-unit	:
206	continued	the price will be
207	assumption	that it continues with tough constraints on public spending
208	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
209	no-unit	As
210	assumption	France is shaken to its core by recent events
211	no-unit	,
212	continued	Germany will want
213	assumption	to see the atrocities as the acts of a murderous cult fuelled by marginalisation rather than join in any putative clash of civilisations
214	no-unit	.
215	continued	It knows better than any other European country
216	continued	where
217	assumption	that leads
218	no-unit	:
219	continued	why
220	assumption	it will successfully handle its own backlash against Islam, Pegida
221	no-unit	.
222	no-unit	Equally
223	no-unit	,
224	no-unit	if	cond
225	assumption	there is a British referendum on EU membership	cond
226	no-unit	,	cond
227	continued	Germany will offer whatever British government the deal necessary
228	assumption	to keep Britain in

230	continued	Its mission is
231	continued	to try
232	continued	to hold Europe together
233	continued	,
234	assumption	keeping at bay the temptations of Islamophobia, nativism, political extremism and protectionism
235	no-unit	.
236	common-ground	It may not succeed
237	no-unit	.
238	continued	But imagine
239	continued	if
240	continued	it did not try
241	continued	or
242	continued	if
243	assumption	Germany itself gave in to the same temptations
244	no-unit	.
245	continued	It would love
246	continued	Britain to recall
247	continued	that at different times it has fought alongside Germans
248	continued	,
249	continued	to drop its fixation with two world wars and now make common cause
250	assumption	to build a great future
251	no-unit	.
252	assumption	Europe would be so much stronger	cond
