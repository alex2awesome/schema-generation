51	assumption	Fair enough: white people's adoption of the term distorted it to the point of misuse and meaninglessness
52	no-unit	.
53	continued	What

106	assumption	certain words are worth appropriation
107	no-unit	,
108	continued	when and how
109	assumption	the words should be used
110	no-unit	,
111	continued	and then
112	continued	when
113	assumption	the word becomes cliche, overused and therefore passe
114	no-unit	.
115	continued	And often in the process
116	continued	,
117	continued	as

125	no-unit	and
126	assumption	black folk are creative
127	no-unit	.
128	no-unit	So
129	continued	even when

140	no-unit	.
141	continued	There

154	no-unit	Nothing
155	no-unit	.
156	continued	The word may lose its novelty

159	continued	stop
160	assumption	saying or using it

163	assumption	the word won't disappear or lose its utility in the black community
164	no-unit	.
165	continued	We will go on
166	assumption	saying bae
167	no-unit	.
168	continued	We will say it to our lovers in casual moments at home, and to our children
169	assumption	to be endearing
170	no-unit	.
171	assumption	We will say it in the grocery store, at the movie theatre and across church pews on Sunday mornings as a substitute for names
172	no-unit	.
173	continued	We will say it to each other 
174	continued	-
175	continued	as
176	continued	we have always done
177	assumption	- lovingly, reverently and mindfully
178	no-unit	.
179	assumption	And with any luck, the word will settle back into its original meaning, sans the unsolicited remix of dominant white culture
180	no-unit	.
