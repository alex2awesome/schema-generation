17	continued	it is remarkable
18	continued	how much
19	continued	hasn't changed: at the heart of the system

21	assumption	to study for three-year full-time degrees
22	no-unit	;
23	no-unit	an expensive route
24	continued	for which they now bear much of the costs

27	assumption	Yet the jobs market has changed beyond recognition
28	no-unit	.
29	continued	Graduates are now responsible for

38	continued	The political debate has focused on fee levels and headline prices to the exclusion of almost everything else, including the benefits and value of a university education - and
39	continued	how
40	assumption	they might be improved
41	no-unit	.
42	continued	The debate about
43	continued	whether
44	continued	the 50% participation target is too high
45	assumption	has been similarly staid
46	no-unit	:
47	continued	surely it's a no-brainer
48	continued	to hope
49	assumption	that at least half of young people engage in advanced learning
50	no-unit	.
51	continued	But what type of learning
52	assumption	should that be?

53	continued	One of the purported benefits of
54	continued	marketising higher education
55	continued	was
56	assumption	that the market itself would deliver innovation and better value
57	no-unit	.
58	continued	But the government massively overegged the potential for higher education
59	assumption	to behave like a market
60	no-unit	.
61	continued	Student demand far exceeds
62	assumption	supply of places and price has become a proxy for quality
63	no-unit	.
64	continued	Little wonder, then

77	assumption	students pay the same for very different amounts and quality of academic provision
78	no-unit	.
79	assumption	This is reflected in the variation in students' own perceptions

107	no-unit	.
108	continued	There is no doubt
109	continued	developments in technology have the potential

127	continued	Other innovations

191	assumption	It should also introduce strong new accountabilities within the sector
192	no-unit	.
193	continued	One way of
194	continued	doing this
195	continued	would be
