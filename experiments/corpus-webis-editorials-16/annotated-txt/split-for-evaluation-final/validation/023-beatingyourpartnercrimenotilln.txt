14	continued	The research 
15	continued	-
16	continued	which also draws on the experiences of partners of the violent men, a small number of children and the staff of these programmes
17	continued	- finds
18	continued	that "the vast majority of men
19	continued	who abuse
20	continued	their partners stop their physical and sexual violence
21	continued	if

44	no-unit	.
45	continued	Ninety per cent of the men interviewed had, prior to the course, made excuses about and attempted
46	statistics	to justify their abusive behaviour
47	no-unit	.
48	continued	After the course, this tendency had barely reduced at all, with

52	no-unit	,
53	continued	when
54	continued	making plain my scepticism about DVPPs
55	continued	I have been told

81	continued	Over half of the women reported
82	statistics	feeling "very safe" after the programme, compared with less than one in 10 before it
83	no-unit	.
84	statistics	But that leaves almost half of the women still in fear
85	no-unit	.
86	continued	One major tactic used by violent men is
87	assumption	to control the household finances
88	assumption	so that the woman is totally reliant on him and has no means of escape

90	continued	The research found
91	statistics	that after DVPP, this behaviour changed "only marginally"
92	no-unit	.

93	continued	There is also some evidence

108	no-unit	.
109	assumption	Perhaps such programmes act as marriage guidance counselling and help keep couples together?
110	assumption	Is this not dangerous?

111	continued	The impression given by the widespread acceptability of these programmes is
112	continued	that those
113	continued	who beat and rape their partners
114	assumption	are in need of support and help, not punishment
115	no-unit	.
116	continued	There are moves by the Home Office

142	continued	We appear

146	continued	which used
147	continued	to be the feminist mantra

175	continued	to take a more robust approach in
