1	continued	No matter
2	continued	how much
3	continued	anyone prayed
4	continued	that the Ched Evans "debate" had completed its race to the bottom this week
5	continued	,
6	continued	it was never going
7	continued	to have done
8	continued	so until
9	assumption	we'd heard in full from Gordon Taylor
10	no-unit	.
11	assumption	That pleasure was always in the post
12	no-unit	,
13	no-unit	and
14	continued	yesterday the PFA chief delivered, with
15	continued	what
16	assumption	we might painfully cast as football's version of Godwin's law: a comparison with Hillsborough
17	no-unit	.
18	continued	"He
19	continued	wouldn't be the first person
20	continued	to be found
21	continued	guilty
22	continued	,
23	continued	maintained his innocence, and been proved right,"
24	testimony	Taylor opined to the BBC

26	continued	"We know
27	continued	what
28	testimony	happened with Hillsborough."

29	no-unit	Oh, man 
30	no-unit	...
31	no-unit	Gordon Taylor
32	no-unit	.
33	no-unit	Or rather, GORDON TAYLOR OBE, as his name appeared in my inbox
34	no-unit	when
35	no-unit	he emailed me once
36	no-unit	.
37	assumption	Sensationally dim, wantonly self-interested, wildly over-remunerated and frequently morally compromised, Gordon functions as an auto-satire on all the worst things people think about football
38	no-unit	.

39	continued	Reputed	Modd-NU 
40	continued	to be the highest paid union official in the world, and one	Modd-NU 
41	assumption	who has been in his job for just the 33 years	modd-ASM
42	no-unit	,	
43	continued	Taylor has now said
44	continued	he didn't mean
45	testimony	"to upset anybody"
46	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
47	continued	though	Modd-NU
48	continued	I need hardly add
49	continued	that he has no plans
50	assumption	to consider his position after his latest display of incompetence
51	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
52	continued	In which case, I hope
53	continued	he'll forgive my
54	continued	considering it for him - an act
55	continued	that has become as essential an annual event for me as
56	continued	putting up the Christmas tree
57	other	or rewatching the early work of Steven Seagal
58	no-unit	.
59	no-unit	Unless
60	assumption	Taylor's presence is dramatically revealed as the second-highest-profile instance of affirmative action for idiots in public life
61	no-unit	-
62	no-unit	the first being Iain Duncan Smith's position in government
63	no-unit	- then
64	continued	it hardly needs
65	continued	pointing out
66	assumption	again that Gordon is no longer fit for purpose
67	no-unit	,
68	no-unit	if	cond
69	continued	indeed
70	assumption	he ever was
71	no-unit	.
72	other	But more on his record shortly
73	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
74	continued	That Taylor should have rifled through his Rolodex of metaphors and alighted on the absolute archetype of victim-blaming
75	continued	in order
76	assumption	to continue obliquely victim-blaming in the Ched Evans case
77	no-unit	...
78	continued	well, perhaps there's a mirthless laugh
79	assumption	to be had there
80	no-unit	.
81	continued	But it would take a stronger stomach than mine
82	assumption	to manage it
83	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
84	continued	The sadness - or rather, one of many acute and diverse sadnesses - is
85	continued	that this was a week
86	continued	in which football was crying out for an intelligent and sensitive advocate
87	continued	,
88	continued	finding
89	continued	itself once more cast in a role
90	continued	it should never be required
91	assumption	to occupy in a truly civilised society
92	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
93	continued	All manner of people appeared convinced
94	assumption	that the game should mitigate the deficiencies of the criminal justice system
95	no-unit	,
96	continued	just as	Modd-NU
97	continued	a worrying number were keen
98	continued	to say
99	continued	Evans was absolutely welcome
100	continued	to work again 
101	continued	-
102	assumption	flipping burgers or sweeping the streets
103	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
104	continued	These are the jobs
105	assumption	that are fit for rapists
106	no-unit	,
107	no-unit	we must infer
108	no-unit	,
109	continued	which must feel hugely complimentary to those non-rapists
110	continued	who are putting in shifts doing the same for minimal pay
111	assumption	right now
112	no-unit	.
113	no-unit	Meanwhile
114	no-unit	,
115	continued	as
116	continued	the Mail's Martin Samuel pointed out
117	continued	,
118	continued	footballers - footballers!
119	continued	-
120	continued	"are
121	testimony	placed in the same bracket as doctors, teachers or legal professionals"
122	no-unit	.
123	no-unit	If
124	assumption	that seems to you like a view of society worth shoring up
125	no-unit	,
126	continued	the week will have felt
127	assumption	distinctly encouraging
128	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
129	continued	As for football fans - the great "them" of many debates - they have spent the week
130	continued	being cast as too thick and impressionable
131	continued	to be able
132	assumption	to make their own judgments about a convicted rapist
133	no-unit	.
134	continued	Evans could have been nothing but a role model, presumably to the vast tumult
135	assumption	who turn out at Boundary Park each week
136	no-unit	(4,415 on average last season)
137	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
138	continued	It's as depressing
139	continued	as
140	assumption	it is disturbing
141	no-unit	.
142	assumption	Such toxicity and lunacy have attached themselves to football and its place in our society
143	continued	that those
144	continued	who love the sport as well as those
145	continued	who play
146	continued	it really need the calm, cool intellect and charm of a Shami Chakrabarti
147	assumption	to lobby in their real interests and those of the game
148	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
149	no-unit	Instead
150	no-unit	,
151	assumption	 they have Gordon Taylor
152	no-unit	,
153	continued	whose focus
154	assumption	was memorably dismissed by Peter Schmeichel during one stage of the Paul Gascoigne saga
155	no-unit	.
156	continued	"Instead of
157	continued	getting great deals on cars and other luxury goods for members,"
158	continued	the former Manchester United and Denmark goalkeeper fumed
159	continued	,
160	continued	"PFA should commit
161	testimony	more time and funds to help the like of Gazza."
-1	par-sep	
162	assumption	Taylor was stung - into self-defence, of course
163	no-unit	.
164	continued	"Peter
165	continued	doesn't know
166	continued	what
167	continued	we've done for Paul,"
168	continued	he announced to the Press Association
169	continued	,
170	continued	"a lot of which has
171	testimony	to be confidential."
-1	par-sep	
172	assumption	It certainly does
173	no-unit	.
174	continued	Except Gordon just couldn't bring
175	continued	himself to keep
176	assumption	it that way
177	no-unit	.
178	anecdote	The next few days were spent with this union leader giving detailed interviews on Gascoigne's mental state and past treatment
179	no-unit	,
180	continued	in which he divulged telephone calls with the player, made off-the-cuff pseudo-clinical diagnoses, and - unbelievably - used the union's own website
181	anecdote	to warn
182	no-unit	:
183	no-unit	"If	cond
184	assumption	we're not careful	cond
185	no-unit	,	cond
186	continued	it is going
187	testimony	to be akin to George Best."
188	continued	Then again
189	continued	,
190	continued	 Taylor had form with sharing details of members' treatment
191	continued	,
192	assumption	having done the same with Joey Barton only a few months previously
193	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
194	other	Anyway, on we go
195	no-unit	.
196	continued	In 2013 came the revelation
197	continued	that Taylor had amassed
198	continued	a
199	continued	?
200	continued	100,000 debt to a bookmaker - almost an inevitability to those
201	continued	who recalled
202	continued	him pontificating about a "zero tolerance" approach to
203	anecdote	betting among players just a couple of years before
204	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
205	continued	And no round-up of Gordon's greatest hits would be complete without a look at that endlessly intriguing confidentiality deal
206	assumption	he signed with News International
207	no-unit	,
208	continued	which awarded him a
209	continued	?
210	anecdote	700,000 settlement for phone-hacking in return for his silence
211	no-unit	.
212	continued	As	Modd-NU
213	continued	the News of the World's lawyers later had it in a letter to the Commons culture, media and sport committee
214	continued	,
215	continued	Taylor's lawyers had informed them
216	continued	that he "wanted
217	continued	to be vindicated or made
218	testimony	rich"
219	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
220	no-unit	Given
221	continued	that he reportedly earns
222	continued	?
223	assumption	984,000 a year (maybe more these days)
224	no-unit	,
225	continued	you might judge
226	assumption	him to be rich already
227	no-unit	- but
228	no-unit	of course	Modd-NU
229	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
230	continued	 we know
231	continued	which option won out, a deal
232	continued	that precluded Taylor from
233	assumption	breathing a word about phone-hacking to any of his union's members
234	no-unit	,
235	continued	who he might reasonably have concluded
236	assumption	could have been victims themselves
237	no-unit	.
238	continued	As	Modd-NU
239	continued	they were eventually
240	continued	proved
241	assumption	(by others) to have been
242	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
243	continued	So there you have him: the pastoral carer
244	assumption	who reveals details of his members' mental health in the noble cause of self-defence
245	no-unit	.
246	continued	The gambler
247	continued	who wishes
248	assumption	to outlaw gamblers
249	no-unit	.
250	continued	The ur-phone-hacking plaintiff
251	continued	who agreed
252	continued	to take the
253	continued	?
254	continued	700,000 and say absolutely nothing about the matter, despite
255	assumption	being responsible for players
256	continued	who of course turned out
257	assumption	to have been targeted too
258	no-unit	.
259	continued	And now he is the victim-blamer's victim-blamer, in a week
260	continued	where
261	continued	,
262	continued	you might have hazarded
263	continued	,
264	continued	even Katie Hopkins couldn't have contrived
265	continued	to make
266	assumption	a grim situation worse
267	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
268	no-unit	Still	Modd-NU
269	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
270	continued	 experience would indicate
271	assumption	that Taylor ignores his detractors at the very opposite of his peril
272	no-unit	.
273	continued	So all
274	continued	that remains
275	continued	is
276	continued	for
277	continued	me to take the early opportunity
278	assumption	to apologise for next year's inevitable appearance of this column, and bid Mr Taylor a cordial au revoir
279	no-unit	.
