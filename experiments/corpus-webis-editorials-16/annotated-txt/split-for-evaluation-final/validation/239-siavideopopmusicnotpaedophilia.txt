-1	par-sep	
1	continued	Australian musician Sia has apologised to anyone "triggered" by her video for Elastic Heart, featuring Shia LaBeouf and 12-year-old dance prodigy Maggie Ziegler, dancing together, in flesh-coloured outfits (Ziegler
2	continued	sporting a platinum Sia wig)
3	continued	,
4	anecdote	in a cage
5	no-unit	.
6	assumption	The video has caused uproar in some quarters
7	no-unit	.
8	continued	Fame-averse Sia
9	continued	(who generally performs with her face hidden)
10	continued	tweeted
11	continued	:
12	continued	"I anticipated some 'paedophilia!!!'
13	testimony	cries for this video
14	no-unit	.
15	continued	All
16	continued	I can say
17	continued	is
18	continued	Maddie and Shia are two of the only actors
19	continued	I felt
20	continued	could play
21	testimony	these two warring 'Sia self states'"
22	no-unit	,
23	continued	adding
24	continued	that her intention was to "create some emotional content
25	continued	,
26	testimony	not to upset anybody"
27	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
28	assumption	The video is jarring
29	no-unit	.
30	anecdote	Famously troubled LaBeouf and Ziegler dance around, wrestling, attacking, playing
31	no-unit	.
32	continued	At one point
33	continued	,
34	anecdote	LaBeouf holds Ziegler aloft
35	no-unit	;
36	continued	at another, he tries
37	continued	to stroke her
38	continued	and
39	continued	she kicks and hisses
40	anecdote	to get away
41	no-unit	.
42	anecdote	Elsewhere, Ziegler wraps her tiny limbs around LaBeouf in a feral grip
43	no-unit	.
44	continued	Watching it
45	continued	,
46	continued	I realised
47	continued	that the intensity
48	continued	(Sia's "emotional content")
49	continued	was the reason
50	continued	it was jarring - the mere fact
51	continued	that the video wasn't carefully benign, cheaply titillating or just plain boring
52	continued	,
53	assumption	like so much else in the genre
54	no-unit	.
55	assumption	In Elastic Heart, the grown man and the young girl are alive with feelings for each other, running the gamut from amusement and play through to fury to despair
56	no-unit	.
57	continued	What
58	continued	isn't
59	assumption	there is sexuality
60	no-unit	.
61	no-unit	In fact	modd-del
62	no-unit	,	modd-del
63	continued	 it baffles me
64	continued	how
65	continued	anyone could look seriously at Elastic Heart and claim
66	assumption	to see any sexual content whatsoever
67	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
68	continued	Can't a grown man and
69	assumption	a young girl produce art with edge and beauty of any kind without a squalid sexual subtext instantly being read into it?
70	continued	Sia seemed
71	continued	to apologise for
72	assumption	potentially triggering memories of child sex abuse and grooming
73	continued	(as
74	continued	some accused her of
75	no-unit	doing, on behalf of abuse victims)
76	no-unit	.
77	common-ground	Of course we all sympathise with abuse victims
78	no-unit	.
79	continued	However
80	continued	,
81	continued	 one would imagine
82	assumption	that such triggers would be everywhere - perhaps mainly focused on the most ordinary and domestic of situations
83	no-unit	.
84	assumption	All of which couldn't be further away from a highly choreographed performance of an arty cage dance
85	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
86	no-unit	If	cond
87	continued	some abuse survivors were genuinely disturbed by Elastic Heart then fair enough, but what about those
88	assumption	who referred to it as an excuse for their own unease?
89	continued	Are these people aware
90	assumption	that Ziegler performed solo, dressed identically, dancing similarly, for Sia's Chandelier video
91	no-unit	.
92	assumption	Did this talented young dancer remind them of child sex abuse then?
93	continued	If
94	continued	not, is it
95	continued	because
96	assumption	LaBeouf was in Elastic Heart
97	no-unit	- so
98	assumption	presumably a woman performing the same dance with Ziegler would have been perfectly fine
99	no-unit	.
100	continued	Is this
101	continued	where
102	continued	we are now
103	continued	:
104	continued	society flinching from the sight of a man and a girl performing together in any way
105	assumption	that hasn't been entirely emotionally neutered?
-1	par-sep	
106	continued	Ultimately, this discomfort seems
107	continued	wrapped up in our own dirty, addled, increasingly paranoid 21st-century mindset, in
108	continued	which paedophilia
109	continued	,
110	continued	once
111	continued	so grotesquely secretive
112	continued	,
113	assumption	is now seen everywhere and in the most kneejerk fashion
114	no-unit	.
115	common-ground	No one could complain about increased awareness of abuse
116	no-unit	,
117	continued	which means
118	assumption	that children are finally protected and believed
119	no-unit	.
120	assumption	Such instincts come from a good (better informed) place
121	no-unit	.
122	no-unit	However	modd-del
123	no-unit	,	modd-del
124	continued	 the situation has surely become overcooked
125	continued	when
126	continued	paedophilia becomes one of the first things
127	continued	we presume
128	assumption	and in the most ludicrous settings
129	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
130	continued	It becomes
131	continued	so that everything, even art, is expected
132	continued	to distil and accommodate all the retrospective guilt of bygone eras: the fact
133	continued	that so many perpetrators of the past weren't caught
134	continued	,
135	assumption	that we were lax, not observant or protective enough
136	no-unit	.
137	continued	In some ways, it's good
138	assumption	not to forget
139	no-unit	;
140	continued	in others, perhaps we need
141	assumption	to get past it
142	no-unit	.
143	continued	The latter is true of Elastic Heart - a video found
144	continued	to be offensive because of sanctioned
145	assumption	hysteria, rather than anything happening on screen 
146	no-unit	-
147	continued	all the more disturbing
148	continued	when
149	assumption	set against the wider background of any artist being scared into silence or self-censorship
150	no-unit	.
151	assumption	Sia should not have been badgered into an apology
152	no-unit	.
153	continued	She had nothing
154	assumption	to apologise for
155	no-unit	.

156	continued	Russia has listed transsexual and transgender people as
157	continued	no longer being allowed
158	anecdote	to qualify for driving licences
159	no-unit	.
160	continued	They are
161	continued	to be classed as
162	anecdote	having "mental disorders"
163	no-unit	,
164	common-ground	which would also include exhibitionism, voyeurism and fetishism of any kind
165	anecdote	(others include compulsive gambling and stealing)
166	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
167	continued	The official line is
168	continued	that this is
169	continued	because
170	continued	there are too many road accidents in Russia
171	continued	and
172	continued	tightening medical controls has become
173	testimony	necessary
174	no-unit	.
175	no-unit	However
176	no-unit	,
177	assumption	 Russian psychiatrists and human rights lawyers have condemned the move
178	no-unit	,
179	continued	which appears
180	continued	to follow on from the infamous 2013 legislation
181	continued	that made
182	assumption	the promotion of "non-traditional lifestyles" illegal
183	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
184	continued	Barring a person from
185	continued	driving for no good reason
186	common-ground	is a serious matter
187	no-unit	.
188	assumption	It takes away not only a civilian right but also a prime symbol of adult autonomy
189	no-unit	;
190	continued	never mind the real logistical difficulties
191	assumption	that being car-less might present in parts of Russia
192	no-unit	.
193	continued	It also means
194	continued	that people
195	continued	who might feel
196	continued	that they'd benefit from some degree of psychiatric counselling
197	continued	would feel less inclined
198	continued	to do
199	continued	so if
200	continued	they feared
201	assumption	losing their cars
202	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
203	assumption	What a farce
204	no-unit	.
205	continued	There are some of us
206	continued	who would like
207	continued	it proved
208	continued	that a certain Vladimir Putin is mentally fit
209	continued	to ride
210	continued	that horse
211	continued	he is often
212	continued	(and so sexily!)
213	assumption	perched upon
214	no-unit	.
215	continued	There are shots
216	continued	I've seen
217	continued	where
218	continued	he looks
219	continued	quite thrillingly "barking"
220	continued	,
221	continued	bobbing about on his saddle, with no top on
222	continued	,
223	continued	brandishing a rifle like the big he-man
224	continued	he oh
225	continued	so
226	anecdote	obviously is
227	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
228	continued	More seriously, this reminds us
229	continued	that it's still important
230	assumption	to keep abreast of Russian moves such as these
231	no-unit	.
232	continued	Big and small
233	continued	,
234	assumption	these laws represent blatant targeting of minorities and cynical affronts to international human rights
235	no-unit	.
236	assumption	This latest one is yet another shift towards the blanket criminalisation of anything other than blessed, state-ordained heterosexuality
237	no-unit	.
238	continued	We must keep
239	assumption	watching
240	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
241	continued	I go pretty low with television, lower
242	continued	than
243	assumption	is dignified
244	no-unit	.
245	no-unit	But
246	no-unit	even
247	anecdote	I have never watched The Jump

261	anecdote	The Speaker's wife, Sally Bercow, also injured herself - her ribs, not her gob
262	no-unit	,
263	no-unit	so
264	continued	she'll be able
265	assumption	to carry on just fine
266	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
267	continued	We all accept this kind of caper as "normal", but on
268	continued	what
269	assumption	premise is such dangerous and sadistic television justified?
270	continued	I thought Splash!
271	continued	was irresponsible
272	continued	(unfit semi-famous people
273	anecdote	falling off high-diving boards after minimal training)
274	no-unit	.
275	continued	But ski jumping 
276	continued	-
277	assumption	are they kidding?
-1	par-sep	
278	assumption	A test of mettle, my derriere; this is Lord of the Flies with frostbite
279	no-unit	.
280	continued	Why
281	continued	don't programme makers go the whole hog and push C-listers into fast-moving traffic and allow
