2	testimony	that TV debates were "here to stay"

4	continued	It was his confident declaration that
5	continued	:
6	continued	"We will have them in every election in the future
7	continued	and
8	testimony	that is a really good thing for democracy."
9	assumption	Many others thought so too

11	statistics	More than 20 million people watched some or all of them
12	no-unit	.
13	continued	They engaged voters in ways
14	assumption	that we hadn't seen before in Britain
15	no-unit	.
16	continued	To many, it was unthinkable
17	assumption	that they wouldn't become a permanent feature of the fabric of our elections
18	no-unit	.
19	continued	It gives me no pleasure
20	continued	to say
21	continued	that I have always had great doubts
22	assumption	that this was really the case
23	no-unit	.
24	continued	For
25	continued	it to be true

31	assumption	TV debates happened in 2010 only because of an unusual set of circumstances
32	no-unit	.
33	continued	Mr Cameron had demanded them
34	continued	because
35	continued	that is
36	continued	what
37	assumption	opposition leaders nearly always do
38	no-unit	.

43	continued	In the wake of the expenses scandal, all the parties were anxious
44	continued	to be seen
45	continued	trying
46	assumption	to connect with alienated voters
47	no-unit	.
48	assumption	The key was Gordon Brown
49	no-unit	.
50	anecdote	Unusually for a prime minister, he agreed to debates
51	no-unit	.
52	continued	His people thought
53	continued	he had little
54	continued	to lose
55	continued	and
56	continued	,
57	continued	 in a typically Gordon Brownish way
58	continued	,
59	continued	he reckoned
60	continued	he would come over
61	continued	as
62	assumption	the man of substance while his Tory and Lib Dem rivals would be exposed as lightweights
63	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
64	assumption	It didn't work out as Mr Brown expected
65	no-unit	.
66	no-unit	But
67	continued	what
68	continued	is most relevant to
69	continued	what
70	continued	is happening now
71	continued	is
72	continued	that it didn't work out
73	continued	as
74	assumption	Mr Cameron anticipated either
75	no-unit	.
76	assumption	The Lib Dem leader, an unknown to many voters before the debates, shone in the first one
77	no-unit	,
78	continued	presenting himself as the true candidate of change to the disadvantage of David Cameron and unleashing the "Cleggmania"
79	assumption	that now seems so long ago
80	no-unit	.
81	anecdote	On election night, I was aboard the boat in the Thames hired by the BBC
82	no-unit	.
83	continued	Among those also present

85	anecdote	was Michael Ashcroft, the Tory donor and pollster
86	no-unit	.
87	no-unit	As
88	continued	it became clear
89	continued	that his party had failed
90	assumption	to secure a majority
91	no-unit	,
92	assumption	he placed the blame on the TV debates
93	no-unit	.
94	assumption	That view has since become orthodoxy in the Conservative party
95	no-unit	.
96	continued	Whether	Modd-NU
97	continued	it is entirely true or not	Modd-NU
98	continued	,	Modd-NU
99	assumption	it has been engraved into the Tory soul
100	no-unit	.
101	assumption	Two people were very badly burnt: Mr Cameron himself and George Osborne
102	no-unit	,
103	continued	who ran the last Tory election campaign and was widely castigated by his colleagues for
104	assumption	agreeing to the debates
105	no-unit	.
106	continued	The chancellor long ago told friends

109	no-unit	.
110	assumption	Lynton Crosby, the prime minister's Australian strategist, is also dead-set against TV debates
111	no-unit	.
112	continued	Craig Oliver, the Number 10 communications chief
113	continued	who has been leading the Tory side in the debate negotiations
114	continued	,
115	continued	is another key figure
116	continued	who believes
117	assumption	it is all downside for them
118	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
119	continued	The first reason
120	continued	that David Cameron and his advisers are against debates
121	assumption	is the traditional one
122	no-unit	.
123	continued	He doesn't want
124	assumption	to concede equality of status to his opponents
125	no-unit	.
126	continued	The experience of the Clegg-Farage debates during the Euro elections hardened the belief in Number 10
127	assumption	that debates are bad for incumbents and a gift to challengers
128	no-unit	.
129	continued	The view around Mr Cameron is expressed by one close ally
130	continued	:
131	continued	"If
132	continued	you are the incumbent
133	continued	,
134	continued	debates are heavily weighted in favour of the insurgents
135	continued	.
136	testimony	It is a rigged game."
-1	par-sep	
137	continued	It is not
138	continued	,
139	continued	as
140	continued	is often assumed, fear of Nigel Farage coming at him from the right
141	assumption	that most worries the prime minister
142	no-unit	.
143	assumption	His biggest concern is giving a boost to Ed Miliband
144	no-unit	.
145	continued	TV debates are the Labour leader's best remaining opportunity
146	continued	to secure mass exposure to voters sceptical
147	continued	that he is up to
148	continued	being prime minister
149	continued	and get
150	assumption	them to reconsider their view
151	no-unit	.
152	continued	So poor are his personal ratings
153	continued	,
154	continued	Mr Miliband might only have
155	continued	to turn up and string together a few half-decent sentences
156	continued	and
157	assumption	more people would think better of him
158	no-unit	.
159	continued	The hope
160	continued	that their man could benefit by
161	continued	exceeding low expectations
162	continued	is
163	continued	why
164	continued	Labour is desperate for debates
165	assumption	to happen
166	no-unit	.
167	continued	Which makes
168	continued	the Tories equally desperate
169	continued	for
170	continued	them not
171	assumption	to happen
172	no-unit	.

173	continued	The Conservatives
174	continued	,
175	continued	as
176	continued	we saw last week with their "dodgy dossier" about Labour's spending plans
177	continued	,
178	continued	want
179	continued	to revert to an old-fashioned model of election
180	continued	in which the campaign is dominated by staged leaders' tours
181	continued	in which the prime minister wafts around the country looking presidential and morning news conferences designed, with a bit of help from their friends in the press
182	continued	,
183	assumption	to shape the campaign to a Tory agenda
184	no-unit	.
185	continued	So, from the off, the Conservatives have done everything in their power
186	continued	to prevent TV debates from
187	assumption	happening at this election
188	no-unit	.
189	continued	The broadcasters and the other parties wanted
190	assumption	to begin negotiations about the format last spring
191	no-unit	.
192	assumption	The Tories stalled
193	no-unit	,
194	continued	saying
195	continued	they wouldn't start
196	testimony	talking until October
197	no-unit	.
198	continued	When
199	continued	the negotiations finally got under way
200	continued	,
201	continued	I am told, and by a variety of different sources
202	continued	,
203	continued	that the Conservatives were determined
204	anecdote	to block any progress toward agreement
205	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
206	continued	"At
207	continued	every stage, they sought
208	continued	to put obstacles in the way,"
209	testimony	says one source
210	no-unit	.
211	continued	Another confirms
212	continued	:
213	continued	"The Tories kept
214	testimony	throwing spanners in the works."
215	continued	According to a third
216	continued	:
217	testimony	"All the parties, including Ukip, took part in good faith except the Conservatives."
218	anecdote	Last time around, "a heads of agreement" about the debates had been written by December
219	no-unit	.
220	assumption	This time around, we have got to mid-January and aren't even close to that
221	no-unit	.
222	anecdote	The last meeting was just before Christmas
223	no-unit	.
224	continued	"We
225	continued	didn't get anywhere because of the Tories,"
226	continued	says one source, an account
227	testimony	that is again corroborated by others
228	no-unit	.
229	continued	I have learned
230	anecdote	that a meeting between the parties and the broadcasters was scheduled for the Thursday just gone
231	no-unit	.
232	anecdote	It was cancelled at the last minute by the Conservatives
233	no-unit	.
234	assumption	No new date has been set
235	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
236	continued	The prime minister's latest excuse for nobbling debates is
237	continued	that he won't do it
238	continued	unless
239	assumption	the Greens are included
240	no-unit	.
241	continued	I happen
242	continued	to agree
243	continued	that the Greens ought
244	assumption	to be represented in one debate
245	no-unit	.
246	continued	There is not much logic to Ofcom's recent preliminary recommendation
247	continued	that Ukip and the Lib Dems should be treated as "major" parties for the purposes of
248	assumption	allocating airtime during the campaign, but not the Greens
249	no-unit	.
250	assumption	They have been nip and tuck with the Lib Dems in the opinion polls and quite often done better
251	no-unit	.
252	anecdote	They have had representation in the House of Commons for longer than Ukip
253	no-unit	.
254	continued	So I agree
255	continued	that it would be fair
256	continued	to include the Greens - and hoot with laughter
257	assumption	to hear that argument coming out of the mouth of David Cameron
258	no-unit	.
259	continued	When
260	continued	did he become obsessed with
261	assumption	championing the rights of minority parties?
262	continued	Who knew
263	continued	he had such a passion
264	assumption	to debate with Natalie Bennett?
265	assumption	In the history of political excuses, this must go down as one of the most terrible
266	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
267	continued	By
268	continued	running away from debates
269	continued	,
270	assumption	the Tories are taking some risk with their leader's reputation and sense of himself
271	no-unit	.
272	continued	Says one senior government figure
273	continued	:
274	continued	"Cameron doesn't like
275	testimony	being called chicken."
-1	par-sep	
276	no-unit	If
277	continued	the Cameron brand is supposed
278	assumption	to be the strong and confident leader
279	no-unit	,
280	continued	why
281	continued	is he frit of
282	continued	debating Ed Miliband, a man
283	continued	the Tories keep
284	continued	telling
285	assumption	us is hopelessly weak?
286	continued	Won't it simply look bad
287	assumption	to deny TV debates to the voters?
288	assumption	Yes, it will
289	no-unit	,
290	no-unit	but
291	continued	the Tories are calculating
292	continued	that any fuss will be short
293	continued	-
294	continued	lived, soon forgotten and, in the end
295	continued	,
296	continued	not that many voters will punish them for it
297	continued	,
298	continued	especially if
299	continued	their spinners can successfully sow confusion about
300	assumption	who is responsible
301	no-unit	.
302	continued	The Tories also bargain
303	assumption	that the press won't make that big a deal of it
304	no-unit	.
305	assumption	About that, they may be right
306	no-unit	.
307	continued	There was resentment among newspapers during the last campaign
308	continued	that their capacity
309	continued	to shape the agenda
310	assumption	was reduced by the TV debates
311	no-unit	.
312	continued	There are journalists and editors
313	continued	who will be secretly happy
314	continued	if
315	assumption	they don't happen again
316	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
317	no-unit	As
318	no-unit	things stand
319	no-unit	,
320	continued	I think
321	assumption	the chances of TV election debates happening are somewhere between zilch and nada
322	no-unit	.
323	assumption	Could anything change that?	m-question
324	continued	Some suggest
325	continued	that the broadcasters should call David Cameron's bluff and threaten
326	continued	to stage debates without him - "empty chair"
327	assumption	him in the jargon
328	no-unit	.
329	continued	Labour and the Lib Dems hope
330	assumption	this will happen
331	no-unit	.
332	continued	Number 10 is assuming
333	assumption	that the BBC wouldn't have the nerve
334	no-unit	,
335	assumption	the other broadcasters will follow its lead
336	no-unit	,
337	no-unit	and
338	continued	holding a debate without Mr Cameron
339	assumption	might anyway be a breach of the laws about election coverage
340	no-unit	.
341	continued	A debate between everyone but the prime minister could even suit the Tories
342	continued	when
343	continued	they want
344	assumption	to project him as the statesman floating above the fray
345	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
346	continued	A more realistic way
347	continued	to flush him out
348	continued	would be
349	continued	to strip him of the Green figleaf
350	continued	he is using as his pretext for
351	assumption	not debating
352	no-unit	.
353	continued	The broadcasters could redraft their proposal
354	assumption	to include Natalie Bennett in one of the debates
355	no-unit	.
356	continued	Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip could say
357	continued	that they'd be content
358	continued	for
359	assumption	her to participate
360	no-unit	.
361	continued	I think
362	assumption	they would
363	no-unit	.
364	continued	Labour and the Lib Dems aren't keen on
365	assumption	including the Greens
366	no-unit	,
367	anecdote	who have been taking votes off both of them
368	no-unit	,
369	no-unit	but
370	continued	when
371	continued	it comes to the crunch
372	continued	,
373	assumption	they'd rather have a debate with the Greens than no debates at all
374	no-unit	.
375	continued	Even then, the Tories are so determined
376	continued	to avoid TV debates
377	continued	that they'd most likely concoct another pretext for
378	assumption	sabotaging them
379	no-unit	.
380	continued	But at least everyone would then be crystal clear
381	continued	who is
382	assumption	to blame
383	no-unit	.
