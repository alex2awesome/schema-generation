3	continued	This is, after all, an institution
4	continued	that has chosen for centuries
5	assumption	to communicate with its followers via erudite documents written in Latin
6	no-unit	,
7	assumption	which must be first translated and then interpreted for us, the faithful in the pew

9	assumption	But even by its own standards, this week's papal pronouncements have been bewildering
10	no-unit	.
11	continued	We thought
12	continued	that
13	continued	,
14	continued	whatever
15	continued	else wasn't clear
16	continued	,
17	continued	one thing
18	continued	we did know
19	continued	was
20	assumption	that the church doesn't approve of contraception
21	no-unit	.
22	continued	But during his in- flight press conference en route home from his Philippines trip, we hear
23	continued	Pope Francis telling us
24	continued	that we don't after all have
25	anecdote	to breed "like rabbits"

27	continued	What
28	continued	he is saying
29	continued	,
30	continued	it transpires
31	continued	,
32	continued	is
33	assumption	that Catholics should use one of several "natural", church-approved methods of contraception
34	no-unit	.
35	no-unit	But
36	continued	this
37	continued	it seems to me
38	continued	only serves
39	assumption	to focus attention on something illogical at the heart of the church's traditional teaching on birth control
40	no-unit	,
41	no-unit	which is
42	no-unit	:
43	no-unit	if	cond
44	continued	the point is
45	continued	that God should have space
46	continued	to "intervene" and make
47	assumption	a pregnancy happen	cond
48	continued	,
49	assumption	surely He/She can intervene just as effectively via a torn condom or a missed pill as via a mistaken calendar calculation

51	continued	One of Pope Francis's strongest messages during his Philippines trip seemed
52	continued	to be
53	continued	that today's families are under threat from efforts
54	continued	to redefine
55	continued	what
56	assumption	"family" is
57	no-unit	,
58	no-unit	but
59	continued	I wonder
60	continued	whether
61	continued	the truth isn't
62	continued	that the Catholic church is under threat from an avalanche of common sense
63	assumption	that is now unstoppable

65	continued	The truth is
66	continued	that the pope - a charismatic and decent-seeming guy
67	continued	whose finger
68	continued	is a good deal closer to the people's pulse
69	continued	than
70	continued	his predecessor's was
71	continued	- is tying himself in knots trying
72	continued	to appear "modern" at the same time as
73	assumption	adhering to official teaching
74	no-unit	.
75	assumption	And it simply won't wash
76	no-unit	.
77	assumption	The church has been peddling a nonsense on contraception for almost 50 years
78	no-unit	.
79	continued	The vast majority of us church

81	continued	going
82	continued	,
83	continued	"faithful" Catholics have voted with our gonads and ignored it, and at some point (soon, please!)
84	continued	Rome is going
85	continued	to have
86	continued	to admit
87	continued	it has been wrong
88	continued	,
89	continued	and
90	assumption	that the "contraceptive culture" is not about a lack of respect for human life
91	no-unit	,
92	continued	it's quite simply about a sensible realisation
93	continued	that most couples can raise two, three or four children better, in every way
94	continued	,
95	continued	than
96	assumption	they can raise 10, 11 or 12

98	continued	But aha
99	continued	,
100	continued	the pope would say
101	continued	,
102	continued	here
103	continued	I am being a cultural colonialist, seeking
104	continued	to impose my first-world notions on those of a developing community
105	assumption	that has a very different perspective
106	no-unit	.
107	no-unit	Well
108	no-unit	,
109	assumption	actually, no I'm not
110	no-unit	,
111	continued	because	modd-del
112	continued	Catholic clerics can look anywhere on the planet
113	continued	and
114	continued	what
115	continued	they will see
116	continued	is that with economic improvements
117	continued	and
118	assumption	women's rights comes a reduction in family size
119	no-unit	.
120	continued	When	modd-del
121	continued	people have choice	modd-del
122	continued	,	modd-del
123	continued	this is the choice
124	continued	they tend
125	assumption	to make
126	no-unit	.
127	continued	Those
128	continued	who aren't making it
129	continued	are those
130	continued	who aren't empowered

134	continued	What
135	continued	we are witnessing in this papacy
136	continued	is a church
137	continued	that realises
138	continued	how far
139	continued	out of step it is with modern thinking
140	continued	,
141	continued	and is increasingly keen on
142	assumption	getting into line
143	no-unit	.
144	continued	At the moment it's beginning
145	assumption	to talk the talk
146	no-unit	,
147	no-unit	but
148	assumption	the footwork is still failing
149	no-unit	,
150	continued	mostly because	modd-del
151	assumption	a bit of honesty and a few U-turns are required
152	no-unit	,
153	no-unit	and
154	assumption	most cardinals and bishops aren't yet ready for that
155	no-unit	.
156	continued	The question is
157	continued	,
158	continued	when
159	assumption	will they be ready?	m-question
160	continued	Because	Modd-NU
161	continued	my fear is
162	continued	that if
163	continued	they leave
164	continued	it too long
165	continued	they'll have left
166	assumption	it too late
167	no-unit	.
168	assumption	The churches might still be full today	modd-ASM 
169	no-unit	,
170	no-unit	but
171	assumption	will they be full tomorrow?	m-question
172	no-unit	Even if
173	continued	I am prepared
174	assumption	to hang on in there, albeit by my fingertips
175	no-unit	,
176	assumption	I don't know	cond
177	no-unit	if	cond
178	assumption	the same can be said for my children
179	no-unit	.
180	assumption	Your instincts are right, Pope Francis
181	no-unit	.
182	no-unit	Now
183	no-unit	,
