5	anecdote	Bikini Kill frontwoman and Riot Grrrl icon Kathleen Hanna scrawled the word SLUT across her stomach
6	no-unit	.
7	anecdote	In the years since, there's been a book called Slut!
8	continued	, countless feminist debates over the reclamation of the word "slut" and, in 2011, thousands of women took to streets across the globe in anti-rape marches called SlutWalks - a reference to
9	continued	how
10	anecdote	victims of sexual assault are often blamed for the violence done to them
11	no-unit	.

12	continued	Like "cunt" and "bitch", many feminists have long tried
13	anecdote	to wrest away from its original users the power and harm of the word "slut" and to give it new meaning
14	no-unit	.
15	continued	Increasingly, though, it's seeming
16	continued	like
17	assumption	we might not succeed any time soon

19	continued	Take Leora Tanenbaum
20	continued	:
21	continued	in 2000, she wrote Slut!
22	anecdote	: Growing up Female with a Bad Reputation chronicling girls' and women's experiences with the word
23	no-unit	.
24	continued	She
25	anecdote	herself was called a "slut" as a high school student in the 1980s
26	no-unit	-
27	continued	long before
28	continued	the term "sexual harassment" was coined - and told me
29	continued	"I had no vocabulary
30	continued	to understand
31	continued	what
32	testimony	happened."

33	continued	Now
34	continued	,
35	continued	 15 years later, Tanenbaum is about
36	continued	to publish another book
37	continued	:
38	anecdote	I Am Not a Slut
39	continued	because
40	continued	,
41	continued	in part, the sheen of
42	continued	reclaiming "slut"
43	continued	seems
44	assumption	to have worn off over the years
45	no-unit	.
46	continued	When
47	continued	she spoke to women
48	continued	who called
49	continued	themselves "sluts"
50	continued	with a "positive and defiant" spirit
51	continued	,
52	continued	all told her
53	continued	the decision had turned against them later
54	continued	- and
55	anecdote	all regretted it
56	no-unit	.

57	continued	Tanenbaum told me that
58	continued	,
59	continued	when
60	continued	women are in closed circle or close-knit community - like a protest with like-minded people, or among friends
61	continued	who understand the cheeky appropriation of the word 
62	continued	-
63	continued	identifying
64	continued	as
65	testimony	a "slut" can be empowering
66	no-unit	.
67	no-unit	But
68	continued	what
69	continued	inevitably happens, especially in today's digital culture
70	continued	where
71	continued	revenge porn, stolen pictures and cyber harassment is the norm
72	continued	,
73	continued	is
74	testimony	that "it always spills outwards."
-1	par-sep	
75	assumption	For them it was an amazing feminist experience
76	no-unit	,
77	no-unit	but
78	assumption	it didn't last
79	no-unit	.
80	continued	Every single person
81	continued	I spoke to
82	continued	who intentionally embraced
83	continued	a "slut" persona ended up
84	anecdote	being treated terribly by people outside of her circle
85	no-unit	,
86	continued	because the culture
87	continued	we live in
88	assumption	is so dominated by the sexual double standard
89	no-unit	.

90	continued	But beyond women	Modd-NU
91	continued	who tried	Modd-NU
92	continued	to reclaim "slut" for themselves	Modd-NU
93	continued	,
94	continued	other feminists have rightfully asked
95	continued	why
96	continued	we should all try
97	continued	to reclaim a word with so much baggage - especially a word
98	anecdote	that impacts different women differently, and brings them a lot more pain than righteous justice
99	no-unit	.

100	continued	SlutWalks, for example, are no longer the cause celebre
101	assumption	they once were
102	continued	because	Modd-NU
103	continued	some women of color spoke out against the ways
104	continued	in which the protests and the reclamation of "slut" focused on the ability of white women
105	anecdote	to simultaneously embrace the word and reject its meaning
106	no-unit	.
107	continued	A group of black female academics, activists, and writers wrote an open letter
108	continued	explaining
109	continued	that "as Black women, we do not have
110	continued	the privilege or the space to call
111	continued	ourselves 'slut'
112	continued	without
113	continued	validating the already historically entrenched ideology and recurring messages about what
114	continued	and
115	testimony	who the Black woman is."

116	continued	Rutgers professor and writer
117	continued	Brittney Cooper wrote at the time
118	continued	,
119	continued	"To organize a movement around the reclamation of a term
120	testimony	is in and of itself an act of white privilege."
121	anecdote	In response, some SlutWalk organizers changed the name of their protests
122	no-unit	;
123	no-unit	today
124	no-unit	,
125	no-unit	while
126	assumption	a handful of SlutWalks remain
127	no-unit	,
128	assumption	the excitement over the movement has waned noticeably
129	no-unit	.

130	continued	But women everywhere are still being actively, physically hurt by the stereotypes
131	continued	that lead
132	continued	people to call
133	assumption	them "sluts"
134	no-unit	.
135	continued	Just look to the high profile deaths of young women
136	continued	who were slut-shamed
137	continued	and a mass shooting
138	continued	where
139	continued	the killer said
140	assumption	he was targeting "blonde sluts"
141	no-unit	:
142	assumption	we're still being targeted because of our identities and sexualities
143	no-unit	,
144	no-unit	and
145	continued	it has, perhaps appropriately
146	continued	,
147	assumption	put a damper on the once-celebratory reclamation of the word
148	no-unit	.
149	continued	Maybe
150	continued	that the wounds inflicted by "slut"
151	continued	- and
152	continued	the culture
153	continued	that encourages
154	continued	people to define women
155	continued	that way 
156	continued	-
157	continued	that we once hoped
158	continued	were superficial
159	assumption	are just too raw and too deep
160	no-unit	.
161	continued	Maybe the speed of the internet is too fast for us
162	assumption	to control a word with so much potential to damage
163	no-unit	.

164	continued	There'
165	continued	s a poster on my living room wall by artist Favianna Rodriguez
166	continued	that reads
167	continued	:
168	continued	"I'm a Slut
169	continued	.
170	continued	I Vote
171	continued	.
172	continued	So Does Everyone I Sleep With
173	continued	.
174	continued	And You're About
175	continued	to be More Fucked
176	continued	Than
177	anecdote	I Am."
178	continued	For me, it captures the brash, in-your-face spirit
179	continued	that the feminist movement
180	continued	I've loved
181	assumption	is known for
182	no-unit	.

183	assumption	But in this time of unprecedented feminist power, the conversation about "slut" can be more reflective than fevered
184	no-unit	.
185	continued	Women
186	continued	who want
187	continued	to call
188	continued	themselves "sluts"
189	continued	shouldn't stop, or be made
190	assumption	to stop
191	no-unit	-
192	continued	I love
193	continued	that women can embrace that
194	continued	which is meant
195	assumption	to hurt them and find power in it
196	no-unit	.
197	continued	But I also know
198	continued	that we can still claim our sexuality and agency without
199	continued	using a word meant
200	continued	to denigrate
201	continued	- a word
202	assumption	that still hurts so many people
203	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
204	no-unit	Besides
205	no-unit	,
206	continued	we don't need "slut"
207	continued	to tell us
208	continued	what
209	continued	we already know
210	continued	:
211	assumption	women have sex
212	no-unit	,
213	continued	some people don't like that
214	continued	and
215	continued	we're going
216	continued	to continue
217	assumption	to do it anyway
218	no-unit	.
