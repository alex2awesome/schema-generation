34	assumption	In Tunisia, the elements of the state, such as the interior ministry, remain bastions of the ancien regime

-1	par-sep	
81	continued	But despite political assassinations, flaring

86	no-unit	.
87	assumption	The contrast with the Egyptian post-revolutionary leadership couldn't be clearer
88	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
89	continued	There are many structural reasons
90	continued	why
91	continued	Tunisia has progressed politically

94	continued	(as
95	continued	many commentators like
96	assumption	to describe its penchant for authoritarian leaders)
97	no-unit	.
98	assumption	The most prominent are the exponentially greater power of the Egyptian military vis-a-vis its North African counterpart and its far larger, and poorer, population
99	no-unit	.
100	continued	But I would argue

112	continued	The problem is
113	assumption	that human rights is a frail political discourse
114	no-unit	.
115	continued	Whether
116	continued	in the most "advanced" democracies like the United States and UK, or developing countries like Egypt and Tunisia
117	continued	,
118	assumption	it's easily swept aside by appeals to core national and/or religious identities and the creation of threats
119	continued	whose defeat
120	continued	inevitably requires
121	assumption	watering down the protections afforded to all citizens
122	no-unit	.
123	assumption	More broadly, human rights exists in a contradictory political framework
124	no-unit	:
125	continued	In most societies they both require revolutionary change
126	continued	to be fully implemented
127	continued	and yet are routinely violated in revolutionary situations

139	no-unit	What's
140	no-unit	more
141	no-unit	,
142	continued	human rights is intimately tied to a notion of individual personhood
143	assumption	that can all too easily be hijacked to a kind of market fundamentalist liberalism

145	continued	or of
146	assumption	working classes at home

152	continued	,
153	assumption	the power and importance of human rights is undeniable
154	no-unit	.
155	continued	It remains one of the most radical concepts of the modern era; first
156	continued	,
157	continued	because
158	continued	it demands
159	continued	recognising others
160	continued	as
161	continued	inherently equal
162	continued	to oneself regardless of their differences
163	assumption	- ethnic, racial, gender, religion, class, or nation
164	no-unit	.
165	no-unit	Second
166	no-unit	,
167	assumption	 they demand strict limitation on state power

172	continued	checked
173	continued	,
174	assumption	normatively abusive of citizens
175	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
176	continued	And this is
177	continued	where
178	assumption	the situation in Tunisia remains perilous despite the smooth parliamentary and presidential elections of the last two months
179	no-unit	.
180	no-unit	While
181	assumption	Marzouki's Congress for the Republic party represents a poorer and more traditional (and southern) component of Tunisian society
182	no-unit	,
183	continued	Essebsi's Nida Tounes Party is not merely tied to the old regime, but to the international financial interests
184	assumption	to which it was beholden
185	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
186	no-unit	Indeed	Modd-NU
187	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
188	continued	 the main threat in Tunisia today, in this regard, is not a religious
189	continued	-
190	continued	secular divide but left-neoliberal, with the two powerful parties working together
191	continued	to suppress all opposition to
192	continued	once again making
193	continued	Tunisia the Arab world's "poster child" for a "broken down"
194	assumption	neoliberal reform model
195	continued	which has always produced
196	continued	- and masked - the desperate inequalities
197	assumption	that led to the revolution against Ben Ali in the first place
198	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
199	continued	For decades, neoliberalism has produced the same results most everywhere
200	assumption	it has been implemented: aggregate growth that mask growing inequality, increasing corruption, crime, environmental degradation and repression
201	no-unit	.
202	continued	The only check on such policies would be a strong and united left (the opposite of the present situation, by some accounts) centred broadly on labour rights, a fair distribution of wealth and resources and fighting against the corruption
203	assumption	that fatally weakened the previous state
204	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
205	continued	But one of the signature strengths of neoliberal ideologies, from Kansas to Cairo, is
206	continued	precisely how efficiently
207	continued	they motivate
208	continued	people to support leaders and policies
209	assumption	that are manifestly against their economic interests
210	no-unit	.
211	continued	A Nida Tounes-Nahda alignment would provide a powerful ideological and political cover for
212	continued	retrenching the policies
213	assumption	that brought Tunisia to the brink of revolution
214	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
215	no-unit	On the other hand	Modd-NU
216	continued	,
217	continued	 there are more positive countervailing forces at work in Tunis
218	assumption	that are cause for long-term hope
219	no-unit	.
220	anecdote	This process is exemplified by the establishment of Dar Essaida, or Saida House, a human rights centre located in and emerging from the local community in one of Tunis' poorest quarters
221	no-unit	.
222	continued	As
223	continued	Hassan explained
224	continued	,
225	continued	encouraging the poor and working class
226	continued	to

243	continued	"This is the only way
244	testimony	to strengthen advances in areas such as women's rights or constitutional reforms

253	testimony	It's a long process
254	no-unit	and
255	continued	it's not fruitful

257	testimony	to judge it now."
