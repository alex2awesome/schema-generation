18	continued	Cameron has also said
19	continued	he abhors "isms" and wouldn't want posterity
20	testimony	to anoint him with one
21	no-unit	.
22	continued	Friends say
23	continued	this makes
24	testimony	him a practical conservative of the old school
25	no-unit	,
26	continued	guided by ancient
27	testimony	and uncodified British instincts of decency
28	no-unit	.
29	continued	His enemies think
30	continued	that is a posh way of
31	continued	saying
32	assumption	he lacks principle
33	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
34	assumption	With no pattern of belief associated with his name, Cameron's legacy will be a collection of tactical manoeuvres, with as many prominent surrenders as victories
35	no-unit	.
36	continued	The true spirit of "Cameronism" in education, for example, is better
37	continued	conveyed in the removal in 2014 of Gove
38	continued	to placate the teaching profession
39	continued	than in his appointment
40	assumption	to shake up the department in the first place
41	no-unit	.

42	assumption	But in no field is the Tory leader's trademark better defined than in his approach to Europe
43	no-unit	.
44	continued	If	cond
45	continued	any political manoeuvre deserves
46	assumption	to be named after the Conservative leader	cond
47	no-unit	,	cond
48	continued	it is the habit of
49	continued	trying

51	continued	that would always leave
52	assumption	them hungry
53	no-unit	.
54	assumption	It might be called the "Cameron concession"
55	no-unit	.
56	continued	Thus has he fed the Eurosceptic pack enough
57	continued	to keep
58	continued	it snapping at his heels
59	continued	and frustrated it enough
60	assumption	that his voice was drowned by angry barking
61	no-unit	.

62	continued	Perhaps the saddest aspect of this spectacle is
63	assumption	that it saw a potentially sound policy trampled in the melee
64	no-unit	.
65	continued	The outline of Cameron's position is
66	assumption	that Britain should stay in the EU but under changed terms
67	no-unit	.
68	assumption	They will change anyway
69	continued	because	Modd-NU
70	assumption	the priority for most other member states is bolstering the single currency
71	no-unit	.
72	assumption	This involves the integration of a euro-core with serious implications for Britain's status one way or another
73	no-unit	.
74	assumption	So the principle of pro- active renegotiation, ratified by referendum, is sound
75	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
76	assumption	But Cameron spoiled a plausible position with cowardice
77	no-unit	:
78	continued	he set his renegotiation up as an empty vessel into
79	continued	which hardliners poured Ukip-ish fantasies of

81	no-unit	.
82	continued	He bought

86	continued	the closer
87	assumption	Britain gets to the exit
88	no-unit	,

91	continued	who want

93	no-unit	.
94	continued	The deadline for his referendum, the end of 2017, was plucked from thin air without regard for
95	continued	what
96	assumption	was diplomatically feasible or economically wise
97	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
98	continued	But the chief reason Cameron's EU policy hasn't worked
99	continued	for
100	continued	him is
101	continued	that voters also consider motive
102	continued	when
103	assumption	awarding merit
104	no-unit	.
105	continued	Those
106	continued	who want a referendum
107	continued	in order
108	continued	to leave the EU mistrust the prime minister
109	continued	because
110	assumption	he wants a different outcome
111	no-unit	;
112	no-unit	and
113	continued	pro-Europeans don't trust
114	continued	Cameron to defend Britain's interests in Europe because the whole policy
115	assumption	came about as a sop to the sceptics
116	no-unit	.
117	continued	That doesn't leave many people
118	continued	who think
119	assumption	the Tories have the right policy for the right reason
120	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
121	assumption	Europe exemplifies the problem
122	no-unit	,
123	no-unit	but
124	assumption	it runs deeper
125	no-unit	.
126	continued	Cameron's team are sure
127	assumption	they are running on an admirable record: economic growth, rising employment, lower crime, a reduced deficit and reformed welfare
128	no-unit	.
129	continued	These are things, like the EU referendum
130	continued	,
131	continued	that should make
132	assumption	the Tories popular
133	no-unit	.
134	assumption	By the same calculation, Labour, lacking those credentials, should be out of the running
135	no-unit	.
136	no-unit	Yet
137	continued	the campaign has started
138	continued	and
139	assumption	Ed Miliband is still ahead
140	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
141	continued	Downing Street clings to the now familiar explanation
142	continued	that voters haven't properly engaged with the choice
143	continued	,
144	continued	and
145	continued	that the Tory surge will come at the eleventh hour
146	continued	when
147	assumption	the reality of a possible Miliband regime penetrates the national consciousness
148	no-unit	.
149	no-unit	But
150	continued	what
151	continued	if
152	continued	Cameron has hit
153	continued	the limit of credit available for five years in charge
154	continued	because
155	assumption	even the good bits don't connect in people's minds with decent motives?
-1	par-sep	
156	continued	That is
157	continued	what
158	assumption	Labour strategists are banking on
159	no-unit	.
160	assumption	Miliband's personal ratings are bleak, except on measures of decency and empathy
161	no-unit	.
162	continued	So those are the leadership qualities
163	continued	his campaign aims
164	assumption	to project
165	no-unit	.
166	continued	The contrast
167	continued	they want
168	continued	to draw
169	continued	is between Cameron's ethical plasticity and a challenger
170	assumption	who sticks to his beliefs
171	no-unit	.
172	continued	Miliband will be cast as a man guided by
173	continued	what
174	continued	David Axelrod, Barack Obama's former aide now advising Labour, calls
175	continued	"a north star" - a compass point
176	continued	that tells voters
177	continued	a leader is propelled by something
178	assumption	more noble than the salvation of his own skin
179	no-unit	.
180	continued	Waverers
181	continued	who don't warm to Miliband
182	continued	(and
183	continued	who aren't irredeemably riddled with anti-Westminster rage)
184	continued	might still be persuaded
185	assumption	that he is in politics for the right reason
186	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
187	assumption	The opposite is true of Cameron
188	no-unit	.
189	continued	Even those in his own party
190	continued	who like the direction of policy
191	continued	cannot sincerely claim
192	assumption	that their leader is driven by much beyond a sense of entitlement to the job
193	no-unit	.
194	assumption	That was less of an impediment in the past
195	no-unit	.
196	continued	For much of the 20th century, Britain was ruled by Conservatives
197	continued	who thought of political theory as something suspect or vulgar
198	continued	,
199	assumption	a folly for continentals and socialists, and no substitute for the innate good sense drilled into English boys at the best schools
200	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
201	continued	The Thatcher revolution disrupted the patrician culture in the Conservative party, but not the underlying belief
202	continued	that Tory rule is a default setting for British politics; the norm
203	assumption	to which the country tends
204	no-unit	.
205	continued	That assumption, more than economic growth, deficit reduction, an EU referendum or any other part of the prospectus, is
206	continued	what
207	continued	makes
208	continued	Cameron think
209	assumption	he can stay on after May
210	no-unit	.
211	continued	It is the confidence
212	assumption	that he is an archetypal prime minister and the only credible candidate for the job
213	no-unit	.
214	assumption	Perhaps he will be proved right
215	no-unit	.
216	continued	He will have
217	assumption	money and much of the press to amplify that view
218	no-unit	.
219	assumption	But even loyal Conservatives can't entirely ignore the intellectual void at the centre
220	no-unit	.
221	assumption	The right has decried it as often as the left
222	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
223	assumption	The past five years have posed huge challenges for Britain regarding the economy, our place in Europe, England's relations with Scotland, the decline of trust in institutions
224	no-unit	.
225	no-unit	But
226	continued	of which encounter with a great problem can it
227	continued	be said
228	assumption	the prime minister truly rose to the occasion?
229	assumption	Cameron doesn't have big answers
230	no-unit	,
231	assumption	he shrinks questions
232	no-unit	.
233	no-unit	And
234	continued	that is
235	continued	how
236	continued	history will remember him
237	continued	,
238	assumption	whatever happens in May
239	no-unit	.
240	assumption	He successfully pursued power and spent it without purpose
241	no-unit	.
