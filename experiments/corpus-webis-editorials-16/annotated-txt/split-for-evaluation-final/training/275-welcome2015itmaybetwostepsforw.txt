109	no-unit	.
110	no-unit	But	Modd-NU
111	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
112	continued	 due to a lack of discipline on my part, I've also allowed

129	continued	that frustrated me 20 years ago
130	continued	:
131	continued	traffic jams, unexpected interruptions, long lines, feeling misunderstood

148	continued	Most of the time
149	continued	it feels rather static
150	continued	,

158	continued	,
159	continued	God loves us
160	continued	as

169	continued	that gets me through bad times
170	continued	is
171	assumption	that God's devotion to me is not dependant on my devotion
172	no-unit	.
173	continued	Knowing
174	continued	that God always meets my messes with his mercy

180	assumption	who've been crushed by unmet expectations of life
181	no-unit	--
182	continued	it announces
183	continued	that because
184	continued	Jesus won for you
185	continued	,
186	continued	you're free
187	assumption	to lose
188	no-unit	;
189	continued	because
190	continued	Jesus was strong for you
191	continued	,
192	continued	you're free
193	assumption	to be weak
194	no-unit	;
195	continued	because
196	continued	Jesus was extraordinary
197	continued	,
198	continued	you're free
199	assumption	to be ordinary
200	no-unit	;
201	continued	because
202	continued	Jesus succeeded for you
203	continued	,
204	continued	you're free
205	assumption	to fail
206	no-unit	.
207	no-unit	So
208	no-unit	,
209	continued	as
210	continued	this new year gets under way
211	continued	,
212	continued	I'll
213	continued	still going
214	anecdote	to try and get better at things
215	no-unit	,
216	no-unit	but
217	continued	it's so much more restful
218	continued	to know
219	assumption	that I live my life from love rather than for it
220	no-unit	.
