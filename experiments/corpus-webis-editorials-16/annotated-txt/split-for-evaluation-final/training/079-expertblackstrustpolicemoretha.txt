57	assumption	who have relied on police as victims
58	no-unit	.

59	assumption	The polls don't distinguish between these two groups

90	assumption	would they report the crime to the police?
91	assumption	Blacks victims don't want other blacks locked up simply due to their race

135	continued	and
136	continued	also when
137	assumption	the reverse is true
138	no-unit	.

139	continued	The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports
140	continued	that whites
141	continued	who are below 200 percent of the poverty level

153	statistics	On average, blacks are victims of violent crime at much higher rates than whites
154	no-unit	,
155	no-unit	but
156	continued	the gap isn't as large

162	continued	data relying on the number of crimes reported	Modd-NU
163	assumption	to police

184	continued	the demonstrations and pundits don't reflect
185	continued	how
