-1	par-sep	
1	assumption	Even by the standards of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the Palestinian Authority's just-thwarted attempt at a UN Security Council resolution was a spectacular waste of time, and needlessly handed Israel a symbolic diplomatic victory

14	continued	Draft resolutions are usually preceded by consultations with Council members, so
15	continued	whoever
16	continued	submits
17	continued	them knows, beforehand
18	continued	,
19	continued	which way
20	assumption	the vote will go
21	no-unit	.
22	assumption	This draft was no different
23	no-unit	.
24	no-unit	In fact
25	no-unit	,
26	assumption	 insufficient support among Council members was the initial reason given months ago by the PA for a delay in the vote
27	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
28	continued	As such, it must have known prior to
29	continued	presenting the draft
30	assumption	that it would fail
31	no-unit	,

35	no-unit	In fact	Modd-NU
36	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
37	continued	 why
38	continued	did the PA try

40	no-unit	Even if
41	assumption	it mustered the minimum votes	cond
42	no-unit	,
43	assumption	the US would have used its veto
44	no-unit	,
45	no-unit	and
46	assumption	the PA knew it
47	no-unit	.
48	continued	Not only	Modd-NU

50	continued	the Americans consistently scuppered
51	continued	any resolution
52	assumption	that places even the slightest criticism or pressure on Israel
53	no-unit	,

55	continued	Washington had been explicit about its intention
56	continued	to use
57	assumption	its veto this time round if necessary
58	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
59	continued	As such, it is puzzling
60	continued	that Jordan's UN Ambassador Dina Kawar

62	continued	whose country
63	continued	submitted the draft with the backing of the PA and the Arab League
64	continued	,
65	continued	said
66	continued	she thought
67	continued	Council members should have had more time
68	assumption	to discuss the proposal

-1	par-sep	
70	continued	What
71	assumption	would be the point in the face of an assured American veto?
-1	par-sep	
72	continued	The only way
73	continued	Washington would acquiesce
74	continued	was
75	continued	if
76	assumption	the resolution called for an end to the Palestinian occupation of Israel
77	no-unit	.

-1	par-sep	
82	continued	Did he actually think anything
83	continued	he could say or do
84	continued	would lead to the US
85	continued	dropping such pressure
86	continued	,
87	continued	or
88	continued	that it would accept the draft
89	assumption	that was presented?
-1	par-sep	
90	assumption	In any case, months of consultations and various reasons for delays only resulted in the continued watering down of the text
91	no-unit	.
92	assumption	This led to widespread Palestinian condemnation, from the public and from every faction
93	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
94	assumption	Among the most prominent critics is the widely popular senior Fatah figure Marwan Barghouti
95	no-unit	,
96	continued	whose party
97	assumption	dominates the PA and includes Abbas
98	no-unit	.
99	continued	Barghouti described the text as an "unjustified fallback

101	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
102	no-unit	Moreover
103	no-unit	,

107	no-unit	.
108	no-unit	As such
109	no-unit	,

113	continued	Israel 
114	continued	-
115	continued	which flatly condemned the PA's push from the outset
116	continued	- would be free
117	assumption	to ignore it without consequence
118	no-unit	,
119	continued	as
120	assumption	it has done with all the numerous Security Council resolutions over the decades
121	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
122	no-unit	Indeed	Modd-NU
123	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
124	continued	 the draft did not contain any wording

126	assumption	Israel to worry
127	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
128	continued	Given	Modd-NU
129	assumption	that the US veto shields Israel
130	no-unit	,
131	no-unit	and
132	assumption	that existing resolutions are ignored with impunity
133	no-unit	,
134	continued	it is astounding
135	continued	that the PA had any faith left in the Council
136	assumption	to attempt its latest futile exercise at statehood
137	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
138	no-unit	Even
139	assumption	the response of its UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour was telling in this regard
140	no-unit	;
141	continued	"The Security Council has once again failed
142	continued	to uphold its charter duties
143	testimony	to address this crises and to meaningfully contribute to a lasting solution in accordance with its own resolutions."
-1	par-sep

145	continued	that the UN is a highly unlikely place for Palestinians
146	assumption	to seek justice
147	no-unit	,
148	no-unit	as
149	assumption	the consistent wishes and support of the international community for their cause is held hostage by just one country
150	no-unit	.
151	continued	The very notion of Security Council vetoes makes
152	assumption	the UN an inherently and woefully undemocratic institution
153	no-unit	.
154	continued	The irony is
155	continued	that in the case of Palestine, a democracy is
156	assumption	to blame
157	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
158	continued	The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, had the gall
159	continued	to say the resolution undermined efforts
160	testimony	to "achieve two states for two people"
161	no-unit	.
162	continued	The entire point of the resolution was
163	continued	to create a state
164	continued	that the existing state is determined
165	assumption	to deny
166	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
167	continued	As such, one wonders
168	continued	if
169	assumption	she even read the draft
170	no-unit	.
171	continued	It seems
172	assumption	the mere mention of Israel automatically triggers an American veto
173	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
174	assumption	This whole months-long affair was an obvious exercise in futility
175	no-unit	,
176	no-unit	during which time
177	assumption	Israel has further entrenched its occupation and colonisation of Palestine
178	no-unit	.
179	continued	The day after	Modd-NU

186	continued	,
187	assumption	this is a welcome development
188	no-unit	.
189	no-unit	However	Modd-NU
190	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
191	continued	 he should have done this the moment
192	continued	Palestine's upgraded status at the UN allowed
193	assumption	it do so more than two years ago
194	no-unit	.
195	continued	Amid Israel's relentless colonisation and occupation, and after more than 20 years of fruitless negotiations, the Palestinians do not have the luxury of
196	assumption	waiting indefinitely for statehood
197	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
198	assumption	As such, the PA must act with the necessary urgency and focus
199	no-unit	.
