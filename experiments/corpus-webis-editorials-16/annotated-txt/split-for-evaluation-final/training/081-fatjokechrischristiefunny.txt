15	anecdote	the team of which he is a fan
16	no-unit	.
17	continued	It doesn't actually seem

21	no-unit	:
22	continued	the kneejerk reaction to a hefty politician is always, inevitably
23	continued	,
24	assumption	to insult his body

76	no-unit	But
77	continued	that's hardly the worst of the stereotypes: a couple of years ago, during a televised "debate" about fatness and fat acceptance with anti-obesity spokesperson MeMe Roth and model Crystal Renn

99	assumption	Chris Christie, for all of his accomplishments, faces the same sort of discrimination as the fat person passed over for a job because of a hiring manager's bias

103	assumption	People look at him and judge his body
104	no-unit	.
105	assumption	They don't evaluate his intelligence based on his decisions
106	no-unit	;
107	continued	they just assume
108	continued	he's stupid
109	continued	because
110	assumption	he's fat
111	no-unit	.
112	continued	They ignore
113	continued	that it does actually take quite a lot of work
114	assumption	to get elected as governor
115	no-unit	-
116	continued	politics is many things
117	continued	,
118	continued	but
119	common-ground	it's never a cake walk

126	continued	Chris Christie is
127	continued	- and
128	continued	this is another uncomfortable thing for someone with my own fairly radical political views
129	continued	to say

131	no-unit	.
132	assumption	His actions are often well-considered
133	continued	(even when
134	continued	I screamingly disagree with them
135	continued	,
136	continued	which happens a lot)
137	continued	and even sometimes moderate, at least in the sense

155	testimony	he countered "'crazy, pathetic posts' with one of his own"
156	no-unit	.

174	no-unit	,
175	continued	I have
