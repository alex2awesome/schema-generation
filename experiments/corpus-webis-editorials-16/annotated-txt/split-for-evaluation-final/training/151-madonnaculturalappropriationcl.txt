28	continued	Who cares
29	continued	if
30	assumption	Madonna straps black ropes on the images of dead black rights icons?
31	continued	As
32	continued	Peter Robinson wrote in the Guardian
33	continued	:
34	continued	"It's slightly heartbreaking
35	continued	that Madonna, an artist
36	continued	who made her name through an intuitive grasp of almost every major trend and zeitgeist fluctuation

39	continued	But sometimes a solely jaded response betrays our own complacency, like
40	continued	resigning yourself to the fact
41	continued	that there will always be people
42	assumption	who think of racist slurs as banter
43	no-unit	,
44	continued	or those	Modd-NU

59	continued	Even though	Modd-NU
60	assumption	Madonna has always been controversial
61	no-unit	,
62	continued	it also seems
63	continued	that as
64	continued	the world around her has got
65	continued	sharper
66	continued	,
67	continued	she has got
68	assumption	duller and more derivative
69	no-unit	.
70	continued	The appropriation
71	continued	that she and others have carried out
72	assumption	is nothing new
73	no-unit	;

76	no-unit	.
77	continued	That's	Modd-NU
78	continued	because	Modd-NU
79	continued	those
80	continued	who are piggybacking on others' journeys
81	continued	do not only have more channels
82	assumption	to flaunt their cluelessness and sense of entitlement (Iggy Azalea, walk away from Twitter)

96	continued	Madonna is a manifestation of
97	continued	how
98	assumption	privilege feeds off the authenticity of "struggle"
99	no-unit	.
100	continued	This is a double plundering
101	assumption	that leads to further marginalisation
102	no-unit	:
103	assumption	the dominant narrative will oppress you, then co-opt you, and then weave you into your own tiny little section of the tapestry
104	no-unit	.

105	continued	Some would argue
106	assumption	that slavery and segregation ended long ago (well, segregation in the US in the 60s and apartheid in South African in the 90s, so not that long ago)

126	no-unit	Of course	Modd-NU
127	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
128	continued	 the charitable position is that Madonna, or to
129	assumption	a different extent, Iggy Azalea, are not doing this with any high degree of self-awareness or design
130	no-unit	-
131	continued	they might see all contemporary culture as equal-access human heritage
132	continued	that they can dip into
133	assumption	and sample as a vehicle for their talent
134	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
135	assumption	They would be right to some extent
136	no-unit	,
137	no-unit	but
138	continued	the sad fact is
139	continued	that these modern iterations of minority culture
140	continued	that they are sampling all

152	no-unit	To put it simply
153	no-unit	,
154	assumption	edginess comes from just that
155	no-unit	:
156	assumption	being on the edge
157	no-unit	.
158	continued	Ironically, all Madonna and her ilk's desperate antics
159	continued	to appear so only
160	continued	confirm
161	assumption	that they are, in fact, utterly comfortable and mainstream
162	no-unit	.
163	assumption	Cultural appropriation is now the standard default of the unoriginal
164	no-unit	.
165	assumption	It is a common and predictable template
166	no-unit	,
167	no-unit	where
168	continued	one becomes a cliche in
169	continued	trying
170	continued	to avoid
171	assumption	being a cliche
172	no-unit	because
173	assumption	you have nothing new to offer
174	no-unit	-
175	assumption	something Madonna would surely be mortified by
176	no-unit	.
