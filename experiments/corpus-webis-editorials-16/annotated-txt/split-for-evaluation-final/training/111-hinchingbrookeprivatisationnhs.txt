1	continued	The great delusion of Andrew Lansley was
2	continued	to imagine
3	continued	that by
4	continued	bringing the market into the NHS
5	continued	,
6	assumption	he could take the politics out
7	no-unit	.
8	continued	News this morning
9	continued	that Circle - the first private company
10	continued	to run an entire health service hospital
11	continued	- is manoeuvring
12	continued	to pull itself out
13	assumption	will demonstrate precisely the opposite
14	no-unit	.
15	continued	The ramifications of privatisation could leave
16	continued	the service more electorally
17	assumption	charged than ever before

19	assumption	Parliament eventually imposed a deeply confused rewrite on the former health secretary's bill
20	no-unit	,
21	no-unit	but
22	continued	his original masterplan 
23	continued	-
24	continued	which David Cameron and Nick Clegg initially endorsed without
25	continued	bothering
26	continued	to read
27	assumption	- was arrestingly clear
28	no-unit	.
29	continued	There would be a new healthcare market
30	continued	where
31	assumption	funds followed the patients
32	no-unit	.
33	continued	NHS clinics and hospitals
34	continued	that couldn't win enough customers
35	assumption	would go to the wall
36	no-unit	,
37	continued	while	Modd-NU
38	assumption	new commercial entrants storm in
39	no-unit	.
40	continued	Holding the ring
41	continued	would be a remote regulator similar to that
42	continued	which oversees the electricity sector
43	continued	- with an overriding duty
44	assumption	to "promote competition"
45	no-unit	.
46	continued	The thinking was
47	continued	that all those painful decisions
48	continued	that the experts always say
49	continued	are needed
50	continued	,
51	continued	but
52	continued	which the politicians have always ducked
53	continued	,
54	assumption	would finally be settled as the unarguable consequence of choices made by patients themselves
55	no-unit	.

56	continued	While	Modd-NU
57	continued	it is true
58	continued	that the particular process
59	continued	that led to Circle
60	continued	assuming control of Hinchingbrooke hospital
61	continued	predates the Lansley reforms
62	continued	,
63	anecdote	tracing back to earlier New Labour flirtations with privatisation
64	no-unit	,
65	continued	its story nonetheless illustrates neatly
66	continued	why
67	continued	the Lansley plan was never going
68	assumption	to work
69	no-unit	.
70	common-ground	Hinchingbrooke is in Huntingdon
71	no-unit	,
72	continued	where
73	continued	- as across much of the south of England - the local area supports more hospitals
74	continued	than
75	continued	a health service planner
76	continued	who was starting from scratch
77	assumption	would go for
78	no-unit	.
79	continued	Every academic and thinktank report in health says
80	continued	that the way
81	continued	to make
82	continued	the NHS more efficient
83	continued	is
84	testimony	"to move care closer to patients in their communities", and away from general infirmaries
85	no-unit	.
86	assumption	But the move is rarely made decisively
87	no-unit	,
88	continued	because	Modd-NU
89	continued	no politician wants
90	assumption	to shut things down
91	no-unit	.
92	continued	The pre-privatisation Hinchingbrooke quietly sank into
93	assumption	being a basket case
94	no-unit	.
95	continued	Private enterprise spotted a chance
96	continued	to prove its worth
97	continued	,
98	continued	and - with some fanfare - rode in
99	continued	to "turn
100	assumption	it round"
101	no-unit	.

102	assumption	Glowing headlines about both improving patient experience and even improving finances would soon follow
103	no-unit	.
104	continued	But today one surely has
105	continued	to ask
106	assumption	how much of that was just sharp PR
107	no-unit	.
108	no-unit	After all	Modd-NU
109	no-unit	,	Modd-NU
110	continued	 the tricky underlying economics of healthcare in the region were not transformed
111	continued	-
112	assumption	as the financial woes of nearby Peterborough and Stamford NHS foundation trust illustrate
113	no-unit	.
114	continued	And now, out of the blue - in a manner reminiscent of G4S's eve-of-Olympics confession
115	continued	that it was not going
116	continued	to do the full security
117	continued	that it had signed up for
118	continued	- the private contractor at Hinchingbrooke has admitted
119	assumption	that it is losing its appetite for the job
120	no-unit	.

121	continued	The same spin
122	continued	that previously flattered the company
123	assumption	is now directed without mercy against the politicians instead
124	no-unit	.
125	continued	The company's statement highlights not only the developing A&E; crisis, but also the "inconsistent and conflicting regulatory regime" in the post-Lansley landscape, as well the gulf between NHS and social care services
126	assumption	that Labour's Andy Burnham has made a particular line of attack on the coalition
127	no-unit	.
128	assumption	These are real problems
129	no-unit	,
130	no-unit	but
131	continued	all could have been seen
132	continued	coming
133	continued	when
134	assumption	Circle first got involved
135	no-unit	.

136	no-unit	If	cond
137	assumption	this were a more conventional marketplace	cond
138	no-unit	,	cond
139	continued	it would be hard
140	continued	to grasp
141	continued	why
142	assumption	serious investors would suddenly be pulling out
143	no-unit	.
144	no-unit	But then again
145	no-unit	,
146	no-unit	if	cond
147	assumption	healthcare were a more conventional market	cond
148	no-unit	,	cond
149	assumption	serious investors would probably not have piled in, particularly in a region with one hospital too many in the first place
150	no-unit	.
151	continued	As with rail franchises, the emerging NHS market is attractive to private industry precisely
152	continued	because
153	assumption	politicians stand behind it with a public chequebook
154	no-unit	.
155	continued	Much more detail is still
156	assumption	to emerge
157	no-unit	,
158	no-unit	but
159	continued	my best guess is
160	continued	that Circle is moving
161	continued	to terminate its contract now
162	continued	because
163	continued	it imagined
164	continued	it would be able
165	continued	to swing more favourable treatment
166	continued	than
167	assumption	it got
168	no-unit	.

169	continued	From outsourced IT systems to over-priced PFIs, the British taxpayer has over a generation been learning the hard way
170	continued	that it is not wise
171	continued	to sign contracts
172	continued	that are hard
173	assumption	to specify
174	no-unit	.
175	continued	When
176	continued	unexpected contingencies crop up private "partners"
177	assumption	have got you over a barrel
178	no-unit	;
179	continued	when
180	continued	you fail
181	continued	to bend to their wishes
182	continued	,
183	assumption	they can simply walk away
184	no-unit	.
185	assumption	Today we are, perhaps, seeing exactly the same sort of problems affecting the NHS
186	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
187	assumption	The big questions in healthcare remain unanswered
188	no-unit	,
189	no-unit	and
190	assumption	the political blame game remains just as intense as before
191	no-unit	.
192	no-unit	Indeed
193	no-unit	,
194	assumption	 it is even spiced up by the enterprising resources of private spin
195	no-unit	.
196	continued	And what solution has Monitor
197	continued	-
198	assumption	Lansley's regulator - floated for Hinchingbrooke's struggling NHS neighbour at Peterborough and Stamford?	m-question
199	no-unit	Why, bringing in the private sector, of course
200	no-unit	.
