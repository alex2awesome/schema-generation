0	title	When should voluntary euthanasia not be an option?
-1	par-sep	
1	continued	This week a court in Belgium announced
2	continued	that the convicted rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken would be put to death by a lethal injection, in spite of the fact
3	anecdote	that the death penalty is banned across Europe
4	no-unit	.
5	assumption	Van Den Bleeken's case was unusual
6	no-unit	:
7	continued	having previously been declared insane and not criminally responsible
8	continued	,
9	continued	he had himself asked
10	continued	to be euthanised on the grounds
11	anecdote	that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in jail
12	no-unit	.

13	continued	Today the Belgian justice minister announced
14	continued	that Van Den Bleeken would not be euthanised after all, amid reports
15	anecdote	that the prisoner had changed his mind
16	no-unit	.
17	no-unit	Nonetheless
18	no-unit	,
19	assumption	 the case provides a fascinating twist to the old debate about euthanasia
20	no-unit	.
21	continued	Should Van Den Bleeken have been allowed
22	anecdote	to die?	m-question
-1	par-sep	
23	assumption	The moral defence of voluntary euthanasia is usually applied to people suffering from a terminal illness
24	no-unit	.
25	assumption	But Van Den Bleeken isn't terminally ill and isn't in physical pain
26	no-unit	.
27	continued	Another traditional requirement is
28	continued	that the wish
29	continued	to die
30	assumption	should be voluntary and competent
31	no-unit	.
32	continued	But how
33	continued	can the choices of someone
34	continued	who has been declared
35	continued	insane
36	continued	be regarded
37	assumption	as voluntary and competent?
38	continued	The concern is
39	continued	that granting his request
40	continued	would make
41	assumption	it a case of involuntary euthanasia
42	no-unit	,
43	no-unit	and
44	common-ground	that is usually seen as morally unacceptable
45	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
46	no-unit	If	cond
47	assumption	there is an issue about Van Bleeken's sanity
48	continued	that is because of his alleged inability
49	assumption	to control his sexual impulses
50	no-unit	.
51	continued	But it could be argued
52	continued	that this doesn't affect the validity of his request
53	assumption	to be euthanised
54	no-unit	.
55	continued	The implication is
56	continued	that while
57	continued	some of his decisions might be involuntary or incompetent
58	continued	,
59	assumption	this doesn't apply to his choice of death over a lifetime behind bars
60	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
61	no-unit	Even so
62	no-unit	,
63	continued	should his request have been granted
64	continued	,
65	continued	given
66	no-unit	that he isn't terminally ill?	m-question
67	continued	One argument for
68	continued	allowing voluntary euthanasia
69	continued	where
70	continued	terminal illness isn't an issue
71	assumption	turns on the idea of wellbeing
72	no-unit	:
73	continued	people should be allowed
74	continued	to choose death
75	continued	where
76	continued	they would literally be better off dead
77	continued	or
78	continued	where
79	assumption	their life literally isn't worth living
80	no-unit	.
81	assumption	Another argument turns on human autonomy
82	no-unit	:
83	continued	we should respect a person's free choices as long
84	continued	as
85	continued	they don't harm
86	assumption	anyone else
87	no-unit	.
88	continued	Someone
89	continued	who is not terminally ill
90	assumption	could still satisfy these requirements
91	no-unit	.
92	continued	Had Van Den Bleeken been allowed
93	continued	to die
94	continued	,
95	continued	critics may say
96	continued	it would have risked
97	assumption	opening the floodgates for other similar cases
98	no-unit	.
99	continued	Belgium has seen a dramatic rise in euthanasia
100	continued	since
101	statistics	the practice was legalised in 2002 and permitted in cases of pain and psychological distress, as well as terminal illness
102	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
103	assumption	Some are opposed to voluntary euthanasia as a matter of principle
104	no-unit	.
105	continued	The philosopher David Velleman argues
106	continued	that there isn't a fundamental right
107	continued	to choose between life and death
108	continued	,
109	continued	and
110	continued	that a person's rights don't expand
111	continued	when
112	testimony	they become terminally ill or psychologically distressed
113	no-unit	.
114	assumption	He is heavily influenced by 18th century philosopher Immanuel Kant
115	no-unit	.
116	continued	According to Kant
117	continued	,
118	continued	morality requires
119	continued	that we respect the dignity of persons
120	continued	,
121	continued	and
122	continued	the dignity of persons makes
123	testimony	them intrinsically valuable
124	no-unit	.
125	continued	For Kant
126	continued	,
127	testimony	a person's dignity can't be traded against their wellbeing or happiness
128	no-unit	,
129	no-unit	and
130	continued	the fact
131	continued	that a person believes
132	continued	that their life isn't worth living
133	continued	doesn't make
134	continued	it acceptable
135	continued	for
136	testimony	them to be euthanised
137	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
138	assumption	The Van Den Bleeken case puts pressure on these standard arguments for and against voluntary euthanasia
139	no-unit	.
140	continued	Suppose
141	continued	that, contrary to Kant's view, voluntary euthanasia is morally permissible as long
142	continued	as
143	continued	the person asking
144	continued	to be euthanised
145	other	would be genuinely better off dead
146	no-unit	.
147	continued	Relatives of Van Den Bleeken's victim may well argue
148	continued	that the fact
149	continued	(if
150	continued	it is a fact)
151	continued	that he would be better off dead
152	continued	is precisely a reason for
153	continued	not allowing
154	assumption	him to be put to death
155	no-unit	.
156	continued	From this perspective, euthanasia looks like a way for him
157	assumption	to circumvent his sentence
158	no-unit	.

159	continued	Van Den Bleeken's victim was Christiane Remacle, a 19-year-old
160	anecdote	he raped and strangled in 1989
161	no-unit	.
162	continued	Her sisters are reported
163	continued	to have said
164	continued	that Van Den Bleeken should be forced
165	testimony	to languish in jail
166	no-unit	,
167	no-unit	and
168	continued	their reaction brings out an ambivalence in
169	continued	how
170	assumption	we think about the death penalty for murder
171	no-unit	.
172	assumption	Relatives of murder victims often demand the death penalty as the ultimate punishment
173	no-unit	,
174	no-unit	but
175	continued	the Van Den Bleeken case suggests
176	assumption	that, at least from the standpoint of the perpetrator, the ultimate sanction may be life behind bars
177	no-unit	.
-1	par-sep	
178	continued	But the intrinsic value argument against voluntary euthanasia can also be hard
179	assumption	to swallow, in this case
180	no-unit	.
181	continued	Christiane Remacle's sisters might balk at the idea
182	assumption	that a murderer's life is intrinsically valuable
183	no-unit	.
184	continued	It's hard
185	assumption	not to sympathise
186	no-unit	,
187	no-unit	and
188	continued	there remain strong reasons for
189	continued	not allowing
190	continued	Van Den Bleeken to be euthanised regardless of
191	continued	whether
192	assumption	his life is intrinsically valuable
193	no-unit	.
194	continued	As
195	continued	long as euthanasia is seen as a way for him
196	continued	to circumvent his sentence
197	continued	,
198	continued	respect for his victim and her family demands
199	assumption	that he isn't given the option
200	no-unit	.
