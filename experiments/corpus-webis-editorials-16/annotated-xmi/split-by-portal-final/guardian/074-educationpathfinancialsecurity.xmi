    <cas:Sofa xmi:id="1" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="I have a very distinct memory from my first day of college: My family's minivan slowly pulling into my dormitory's parking lot, through a crowd of first-year students flanked by helicopter parents and, in retrospect, probably hungover orientation week advisers. I remember thinking &quot;Hurry up! I'm ready to start my real life.&quot;&#10;&#10;I had no idea what I was really rushing towards.&#10;&#10;As the only daughter of Nigerian immigrants with a tenuous-at-best toehold on the middle class, college was billed as the only path to financial security. &quot;No one can ever take away your education,&quot; my father would say repeatedly. While that may be true, two degrees later someone could take away my access to decent housing because of my shit credit, thanks to the nearly $60,000 in student loans I've essentially defaulted on since graduating from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University.&#10;&#10;It seems a college education is part of the American dream that's easy to buy (or borrow) into, but hard to pay off.&#10;&#10;With tuition soaring, and the middle class shrinking along with their incomes, many students and their families are left holding incredibly expensive bags. In 2013, 69% of graduating seniors at public and private nonprofit colleges took out student loans to pay for college, and &quot;about one-fifth of new graduates' debt was in private loans,&quot; according to the Project on Student Debt. Even public schools - long considered a more affordable option - are less accessible: public colleges increasingly rely on tuition dollars as state funding continues to fall (25% and 23%, respectively, in 2012, compared to 17% and 23% in 2003). The country's cumulative student loan debt ($1.1tn) has surpassed car loans ($875bn) and credit card debt ($659bn). Though college graduates make more than their peers who only graduated from high school, for many, monthly student loans leach into that extra $17,500 in salary.&#10;&#10;Yet the party line that college education is the middle class' only hope for upward mobility persists - it will even be the message of President Obama's last stop on his &quot;SOTU Spoiler&quot; tour in Knoxville, Tennessee.&#10;&#10;&quot;In today's economy,&quot; Dan Pfeiffer, the president's senior advisor, wrote on Medium, &quot;access to a college education is the surest ticket to the middle class -- and the President's proposals will help more young people punch that ticket.&quot;&#10;&#10;As someone who punched that ticket twice, I'm still waiting for my express bus to the middle class. The modest income I make as an entrepreneur with a day job is whittled away each month thanks to loan payments (plus interest) to various financial intuitions that feel more like bounty hunters than supporters of middle-class aspirants.&#10;&#10;With that $60,000 in student loans hanging over me, I'm still waiting to start the &quot;real&quot; life I'd always imagined for myself. It's just that now I want one with its possibilities a little less hampered by student debt."/>
